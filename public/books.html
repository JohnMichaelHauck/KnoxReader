<p id="iii.i-p1" shownumber="no">
      In the Records of Glasgow, mention is found of one that, in the year of God 1422, was burnt for heresy. His name is not given,
      and of his opinions or of the order upon which he was condemned there is no evidence left. But our Chronicles make
      mention that, in the days of King James the First, about the year of God 1431, there was apprehended in the University
      of St. Andrews one named Paul Craw, a Bohemian, who was accused of heresy before such as then were called Doctors of
      Theology. The principal accusation against him was that, in his opinion of the Sacrament, he followed John Huss and
      Wycliffe, who denied that the substance of bread and wine were changed by virtue of any words, or that confession should
      be made to priests, or prayers made to saints departed.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p1.1">Paul Craw: A.D. 1431.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p2" shownumber="no">God gave unto the said Paul Craw grace to resist his persecutors, and not to consent to their impiety, and he was committed
      to the secular judge (for our bishops follow Pilate, who both did condemn, and also washed his hands) who condemned
      him to the fire. Therein he was<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_2">2</span> consumed at St. Andrews, about the time
      mentioned. To declare themselves to be of the generation of Satan, who from the beginning hath been enemy to the truth
      and desireth the same to be hid from the knowledge of men, they put a ball of brass in his mouth, to the end that he
      should not give confession of his faith to the people, nor yet that they should understand the defence which he had
      against his unjust accusation and condemnation.

<p id="iii.i-p3" shownumber="no">These practices did not greatly advance the kingdom of darkness, nor were they able utterly to extinguish the truth. In the
      days of King James the Second and King James the Third we find small question of religion moved within this Realm,
      but in the time of King James the Fourth, in the year of God 1494, thirty persons were summoned before the King and
      his Great Council, by Robert Blackader, called Archbishop of Glasgow. Some of these dwelt in Kyle-Stewart, some in
      King's-Kyle, and some in Cunningham. Amongst them were George Campbell of Cessnock, Adam Reid of Barskymming, John
      Campbell of New Mills, Andrew Shaw of Polkemmet, Helen Chalmers, Lady Polkellie, and Marion Chalmers, Lady Stair.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p3.1">Whereof the Lollards of Kyle were accused.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p4" shownumber="no">These were called the Lollards of Kyle. In the Register of Glasgow we find the Articles of Belief for which they were accused.
      These were as follows:—(1) Images are not to be possessed, nor yet to be worshipped. (2) Relics of Saints are not to
      be worshipped. (3) Laws and Ordinances of men vary from time to time, and so do those of the Pope. (4) It is not lawful
      to fight, or to defend the faith. (We translate according to the barbarousness of their Latin and dictament.<sup class="Note"

      (5) Christ gave power to Peter only, and not to his successors, to bind and loose within the Kirk. (6) Christ ordained
      no priests to consecrate. (7) After the consecration in the Mass, there remains bread; and the natural body of Christ
      is not there. (8) Tithes ought not to be given to Ecclesiastical Men—as they were then called. (9) Christ at His coming
      took away power from Kings to judge. (This article we doubt not to<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_3">3</span> be the
      venomous accusation of the enemies, whose practice has ever been to make the doctrine of Jesus Christ suspect to Kings
      and rulers, as if God thereby would depose them from their royal seats, while, on the contrary, nothing confirms the
      power of magistrates more than does God's Word.—But to the Articles.) (10) Every faithful man or woman is a priest.
      (11) The anointing of kings ceased at the coming of Christ. (12) The Pope is not the successor of Peter—except where
      Christ said, "Go behind me, Satan." (13) The Pope deceiveth the people by his bulls and his indulgences. (14) The Mass
      profiteth not the souls that are in purgatory. (15) The Pope and the bishops deceive the people by their pardons. (16)
      Indulgences to fight against the Saracens ought not to be granted. (17) The Pope exalts himself against God and above
      God. (18) The Pope cannot remit the pains of purgatory. (19) The blessings of the bishops—of dumb dogs they should
      have been styled—are of no value. (20) The excommunication of the Kirk is not to be feared. (21) In no case is it lawful
      to swear. (22) Priests may have wives, according to the constitution of the law. (23) True Christians receive the body
      of Jesus Christ every day. (24) After matrimony is contracted, the Kirk may make no divorce. (25) Excommunication binds
      not. (26) The Pope forgives not sins, but only God. (27) Faith should not be given to miracles. (28) We should not
      pray to the glorious Virgin Mary, but to God only. (29) We are no more bound to pray in the kirk than in other places.
      (30) We are not bound to believe all that the Doctors of the Kirk have written. (31) Such as worship the sacrament
      of the Kirk—we suppose they meant the sacrament of the altar—commit idolatry. (32) The Pope is the head of the Kirk
      of Antichrist. (33) The Pope and his ministers are murderers. (34) They which are called principals in the Church are
      thieves and robbers.

<p id="iii.i-p5" shownumber="no">Albeit that the accusation of the Archbishop and his accomplices was very grievous, God so assisted his servants, partly
      by inclining the King's heart to gentleness (for divers of them were his great familiars), and partly by giving bold
      and godly answers to their accusators, that the enemies<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_4">4</span> in the end were
      frustrated in their purpose. When the Archbishop, in mockery, said to Adam Reid of Barskymming, "Reid, believe ye that
      God is in heaven?" He answered, "Not as I do the Sacraments seven." Thereat the Archbishop, thinking to have triumphed,
      said, "Sir, lo, he denies that God is in heaven." The King, wondering, said, "Adam Reid, what say ye?" The other answered,
      "Please your Grace to hear the end betwixt the churl and me." Therewith he turned to the Archbishop and said, "I neither
      think nor believe, as thou thinkest, that God is in heaven; but I am most assured that He is not only in heaven, but
      also on earth. Thou and thy faction declare by your works that either ye think there is no God at all, or else that
      He is so shut up in heaven that He regards not what is done on earth. If thou didst firmly believe that God was in
      heaven, thou shouldst not make thyself cheek-mate<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p5.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p5.1">3</a></sup>

      His Evangel, and not to play the proud prelates, as all the rabble of you do this day. And now, Sir," said he to the
      King, "judge ye whether the Bishop or I believe best that God is in heaven." While the Archbishop and his band could
      not well revenge themselves, and while many taunts were given them in their teeth, the King, willing to put an end
      to further reasoning, said to the said Adam Reid, "Wilt thou burn thy bill?"<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p5.2"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p5.2">4</a></sup>
      <span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.i-p5.2"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.i-p5.2">4</a></sup>The form of burning one's bill, on recanting, was this,—the
                  person accused was to bring a faggot of dry sticks, and burn it publicly, by which ceremony he signified
                  that he destroyed that which should have been the instrument of his death.—Keith.</span> He answered,
      "Sir, the Bishop and ye will." With these and the like scoffs the Archbishop and his band were so dashed out of countenance
      that the greatest part of the accusation was turned to laughter.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p5.3">Archbishop James Beaton.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p6" shownumber="no">After that diet, we find almost no question for matters of religion, for the space of nigh thirty years. For not long after,
      to wit, in the year of God 1508, the said Archbishop Blackader departed this life, while journeying in his superstitious
      devotion to Jerusalem. Unto him succeeded Mr. James Beaton, son to the Laird of Balfour,<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_5">5</span>      in Fife. More careful for the world than he was to preach Christ, or yet to advance any religion, but for the fashion
      only, he sought the world, and it fled him not. At once he was Archbishop of St. Andrews, Abbot of Dunfermline, Arbroath,
      and Kilwinning, and Chancellor of Scotland. After the unhappy field of Flodden, in which perished King James the Fourth,
      with the greater part of the nobility of the realm, the said Beaton with the rest of the prelates, had the whole regiment
      <sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p6.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p6.1">5</a></sup><span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.i-p6.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.i-p6.1">5</a></sup>Rule; control.</span>      of the realm. By reason thereof, he held and travailed to hold the truth of God in thraldom and bondage, until it pleased
      God of His great mercy, in the year of God 1527, to raise up His servant, Master Patrick Hamilton, at whom our history
      doth begin. Because men of fame and renown have in divers works written of his progeny, life, and erudition, we omit
      all curious repetition. If any would know further of him than we write, we send them to Francis Lambert, John Firth,
      and to that notable work, lately set forth by John Foxe, Englishman, of the Lives and Deaths of Martyrs within this
      Isle, in this our age.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p6.2">The Coming of Patrick Hamilton.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p7" shownumber="no">This servant of God, the said Master Patrick, being in his youth provided with reasonable honour and living (he was titular
      Abbot of Ferne), as one hating the world and the vanity thereof, left Scotland, and passed to the schools in Germany;
      for then the fame of the University of Wittenberg was greatly divulged in all countries. There, by God's providence,
      he became familiar with these lights and notable servants of Christ Jesus of that time, Martin Luther, Philip Melanchthon,
      and the said Francis Lambert, and he did so grow and advance in godly knowledge, joined with fervency and integrity
      of life, that he was in admiration with many. The zeal of God's glory did so eat him up, that he could of no long continuance
      remain abroad, but returned to his country, where the bright beams of the true light, which by God's grace was planted
      in his heart, began most abundantly to burst forth, as well in public as in secret. Besides his godly knowledge, he
      was well learned in philosophy. He abhorred sophistry, and would that the text<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_6">6</span>      of Aristotle should have been better understood and more used in the schools than then it was: for sophistry had corrupted
      all, as well in divinity as in humanity.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p7.1">Persecution of Patrick Hamilton.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p8" shownumber="no">In short process of time, the fame of the said Master Patrick's reasoning and doctrine troubled the clergy, and came to the
      ears of Archbishop James Beaton. Being a conjured enemy to Jesus Christ, and one that long had had the whole regiment
      of this realm, he bare impatiently that any trouble should be made in that kingdom of darkness whereof, within this
      realm, he was the head. Therefore, he so travailed with the said Master Patrick, that he got him to St. Andrews, where,
      after conference for divers days, he received his freedom and liberty. The said Archbishop and his bloody butchers,
      called Doctors, seemed to approve his doctrine, and to grant that many things craved reformation in the ecclesiastical
      regiment. Amongst the rest, there was one that secretly consented with Master Patrick almost in all things, Friar Alexander
      Campbell, a man of good wit and learning, but corrupted by the world, as after we will hear. When the bishops and the
      clergy had fully understood the mind and judgment of the said Master Patrick, fearing that by him their kingdom should
      be damaged, they travailed with the King, who then was young and altogether at their command, that he should pass in
      pilgrimage to St. Duthac in Ross, to the end that no intercession should be made for the life of the innocent servant
      of God. He, suspecting no such cruelty as in their hearts was concluded, remained still, a lamb among the wolves, until
      he was intercepted in his chamber one night, and by the Archbishop's band was carried to the Castle. There he was kept
      that night; and in the morning, produced in judgment, was condemned to die by fire for the testimony of God's truth.
      The Articles for which he suffered were but of pilgrimage, purgatory, prayer to saints and prayer for the dead, and
      such trifles; albeit matters of greater importance had been in question, as his Treatise may witness. That the condemnation
      should have greater authority, the Archbishop and his doctors caused the same to be subscribed by all those of any
      estimation that were present, and, to make their number<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_7">7</span> great, they took
      the subscriptions of children, if they were of the nobility; for the Earl of Cassillis, being then but twelve or thirteen
      years of age, was compelled to subscribe to Master Patrick's death, as he himself did confess.

<p id="iii.i-p9" shownumber="no">Immediately after dinner, the fire was prepared before the old College, and Master Patrick was led to the place of execution.
      Men supposed that all was done but to give him a fright, and to have caused him to have recanted and become recreant
      to those bloody beasts. But God, for His own glory, for the comfort of His servant, and for manifestation of their
      beastly tyranny, had otherwise decreed. He so strengthened His faithful witness that neither the love of life nor yet
      the fear of that cruel death could move him a jot to swerve from the truth once professed. At the place of execution
      he gave to his servant, who had been chamber-child

      they will profit thee. After this, thou canst receive no commodity from me, except the example of my death. That, I
      pray thee, bear in mind; for, albeit it be bitter to the flesh and fearful before men, it is the entrance unto eternal
      life, which none shall possess who deny Christ Jesus before this wicked generation."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p10" shownumber="no">The innocent servant of God being bound to the stake in the midst of some coals, some timber, and other matter appointed
      for the fire, a train of powder was made and set afire. This gave a glaise<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p10.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p10.1">7</a></sup>

And so remained he in torment,
      until men ran to the Castle again for more powder, and for wood more able to take fire. When at last this was kindled,
      with loud voice he cried, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit! How long shall darkness overwhelm this realm? And how long
      wilt Thou suffer this tyranny of men?" The fire was slow, and therefore was his torment the more. But most of all was
      he grieved by certain wicked men, amongst whom Campbell the Black Friar (of whom we spoke before) was
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_8">8</span> principal. These continually cried, "Convert, heretic; call upon our Lady:
      say <i>Salve Regina</i>," etc. To them he answered, "Depart, and trouble me not, ye messengers of Satan." But, while
      the foresaid Friar still roared one thing with great vehemency, he said unto him, "Wicked man, thou knowest the contrary,
      and the contrary to me thou hast confessed: I appeal thee before the tribunal seat of Jesus Christ!" After these words,
      and others that could not well be understood or marked, both for the tumult and the vehemence of the fire, the witness
      of Jesus Christ got victory, after long suffering, on the last day of February in the year of God 1527. The said Friar
      departed this life within few days after, in what estate we refer to the manifestation of the general day. But it was
      plainly known that he died, in Glasgow, in a frenzy, and as one in despair.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p10.3">Questionings arise.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p11" shownumber="no">When these cruel wolves had, as they supposed, clean devoured the prey, they found themselves in worse case than they were
      before; for within St. Andrews, yea, almost within the whole realm, of those who heard of that deed, there was none
      found who began not to inquire, Wherefore was Master Patrick Hamilton burnt? When his Articles were rehearsed, it was
      questioned whether such Articles were necessarily believed under pain of damnation. And so, within short space, many
      began to call in doubt that which before they held for a certain truth, in so much that the University of St. Andrews,
      and St. Leonard's College principally, by the labours of Master Gavin Logie, and the novices of the Abbey, by those
      of the Sub-Prior, began to smell somewhat of the truth, and to espy the vanity of the received superstition. Within
      a few years, both Black and Grey Friars began publicly to preach against the pride and idle life of bishops, and against
      the abuses of the whole ecclesiastical estate.

      Andrews, and communicated the heads of his sermon to Master John Major, whose word then was held as an oracle in matters
      of religion. Being assured by him that such doctrine might well be defended, and that he would defend it, for it contained
      no heresy, there was a day appointed to the said Friar, to make repetition of the same sermon. Advertisement was given
      to all who were offended to be present. And so, in the parish kirk of St. Andrews, upon the day appointed, appeared
      the said Friar, and had amongst his auditors Master John Major, Master George Lockhart, the Abbot of Cambuskenneth,
      and Master Patrick Hepburn, Prior of St. Andrews, with all the Doctors and Masters of the Universities. The theme of
      his sermon was, "Truth is the strongest of all things."

      for it was the very separation of man from God; but that it should not be used rashly, and for every light cause, but
      only against open and incorrigible sinners. "But now," said he, "the avarice of priests, and the ignorance of their

      Dunfermline, where gossips were drinking their Sunday penny, he, being dry, asked drink. "Yes, Father," said one of
      the gossips, "ye shall have drink; but ye must first resolve a doubt which has arisen amongst us, to wit, What servant
      will serve a man best on least expense?" "The good Angel," said I, "who is man's keeper, does great service without

<p id="iii.i-p14" shownumber="no">As concerning miracles, the Friar declared what diligence the ancients took to try true miracles from false. "But now," said
      he, "the greediness of priests not only receives false miracles, but they even cherish and fee knaves on purpose, that
      their chapels may be the better renowned, and their offering be augmented. Thereupon are many chapels founded, as if
      our Lady were mightier, and as if she took more pleasure in one place than in another. Of late days our Lady of Carsegreen
      has hopped from one green hillock to another! Honest men of St. Andrews," said he, "if ye love your wives and your
      daughters, hold them at home, or else send them in honest company; for, if ye knew what miracles were kythed<sup class="Note"

And thus he merrily taunted the trysts of whoredom and adultery used
      at such devotion. Another Article in his sermon was judged more hard; for he alleged from the Common Law that the Civil
      Magistrate might correct the Churchmen, and for open vices deprive them of their benefices.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p15" shownumber="no">Notwithstanding this kind of preaching, this Friar remained Papist in his heart. The rest of the Friars, fearing to lose
      the benediction of the bishops, to wit, their malt and their meal and their other appointed pension, caused the said
      Friar to fly to England, and there, for defence of the Pope and Papistry, he was cast into prison at King Harry's commandment.
      But so it pleaseth God to open up the mouth of Baalam's own<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_11">11</span> ass, to cry
      out against the vicious lives of the clergy of the age.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p16" shownumber="no">Shortly after this, new consultation was taken that some should be burnt; for men began to speak very freely. A merry gentleman
      named John Lindsay, familiar to Archbishop James Beaton, standing by when consultation was had, said, "My Lord, if
      ye burn any more, unless ye follow my counsel, ye will utterly destroy yourselves. If ye will burn them, let them be

But, so fearful was it then to speak anything against
      priests, the least word spoken against them, albeit it was spoken in a man's sleep, was judged heresy. Richard Carmichael,
      yet living in Fife, being young and a singer in the Chapel Royal of Stirling, happened in his sleep to say, "The Devil
      take away the priests, for they are a greedy pack." He was accused by Sir George Clapperton, Dean of the said Chapel,
      and was for this compelled to burn his bill.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p16.3">Friar Alexander Seton preaches the Evangel.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p17" shownumber="no">God shortly after raised up stronger champions against the priests. Alexander Seton, a Black Friar, of good learning and
      estimation, began to tax the corrupt doctrine of the Papistry. For the space of a whole Lent he taught the commandments
      of God only, ever beating in the ears of his auditors that the law of God had not been truly taught for many years,
      men's traditions having obscured the purity of it. These were his accustomed propositions. First: Christ Jesus is the
      end and perfection of the law. Second: There is no sin where God's law is not violated. And, third: To satisfy for
      sin lies not in man's power, but the remission thereof comes by unfeigned repentance, and by faith apprehending God
      the Father, merciful in Christ Jesus, His Son. While oftentimes this Friar put his auditors in mind of these and the
      like heads, and made no mention of purgatory, pardons, pilgrimage, prayer to saints, or such trifles, the dumb doctors
      and the rest of that forsworn rabble began to suspect him. They said nothing publicly until Lent was ended, and he
      had gone to Dundee. Then, in his<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_12">12</span> absence, one hired for that purpose openly
      damned the whole doctrine that he had taught. This coming to the ears of the said Friar Alexander, then in Dundee,
      he returned without delay to St. Andrews, caused immediately to jow<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p17.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p17.1">20</a></sup>

      bell, and to give signification that he would preach; as he did indeed. In this sermon, more plainly than at any other
      time, he affirmed whatsoever in all his sermons he had taught during the whole Lent-tide; adding that within Scotland
      there was no true bishop, if bishops were to be known by such notes and virtues as St. Paul requires in bishops.

      a bishop to be a preacher, or else he was but a dumb dog, and fed not the flock, but fed his own belly." The man, being
      witty, and minded of his most assured defence, said, "My Lord, the reporters of such things are manifest liars." Thereat
      the Archbishop rejoiced, and said, "Your answer pleases me well: I never could think that ye would be so foolish as
      to affirm such things. Where are these knaves that have brought me this tale?" These compearing<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p18.2"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p18.2">22</a></sup>

      men were brought to attention, and then he turned to the Archbishop and said, "My Lord, ye may see and consider what
      ears these asses have, who cannot discern betwixt Paul, Isaiah, Zechariah, Malachi, and Friar Alexander Seton. In very
      deed, my Lord, I said that Paul says, 'It behoveth a bishop to be a teacher.' Isaiah saith, that 'they that feed not
      the flock are dumb dogs.' And Zechariah saith, 'They are idle pastors.' I of my own head affirmed nothing, but I declared
      what the Spirit of God had before pronounced. If ye be not offended at Him, my Lord, ye cannot justly be offended at
      me. And so, yet again, my Lord, I say that they are manifest liars that reported unto you that I said that ye and others

</div>
<p id="iii.i-p20" shownumber="no">Albeit, the Archbishop was highly offended at the scoff and bitter mock, as well as at the bold liberty of that learned man;
      yet durst he not hazard for that present to execute his malice conceived. Not only feared he the learning and bold
      spirit of the man, but also the favour that he had with the people, as well as with the Prince, King James the Fifth.
      With him he had good credit; for he was at that time his confessor, and had exhorted him to the fear of God, to the
      meditation of God's law, and to purity of life. The Archbishop, with his complices, foreseeing what danger might come
      to their Estate, if such familiarity should continue betwixt the Prince and a man so learned and so repugnant to their
      affections, laboured to make the said Friar Alexander odious unto the King's Grace. With the assistance of the Grey
      Friars, who by their hypocrisy deceived many, they readily found means to traduce the innocent as a heretic.

<p id="iii.i-p21" shownumber="no">This accusation was easily received and more easily believed by the carnal Prince, who was altogether given to the filthy
      lusts of the flesh, and abhorred all counsel repugnant thereto. He did remember what a terror the admonitions of the
      said Alexander were unto his corrupted conscience, and without resistance he subscribed to their accusation, affirming
      that he knew more than they did in that matter; for he understood well enough that he smelled of the new doctrine,
      from such things as he had shewn to him under confession. Therefore, he promised that he should follow the counsel
      of the bishops in punishing him and all others of that sect. These things understood by the said Alexander, as well
      by information of his friends and familiars, as by the strange countenance of the King unto him, he provided the next
      way to avoid the fury of a blinded Prince. In his habit, he departed the realm, and, coming to Berwick, wrote back

<p id="iii.i-p22" shownumber="no">After the death of that constant witness of Jesus Christ, Master Patrick Hamilton, when God disclosed the wickedness of the
      wicked, as we have seen, there was one Forrest of Linlithgow taken. After long imprisonment in the<span class="pb"
            id="iii.i-Page_14">14</span> Sea Tower of St. Andrews, this man was adjudged to the fire by the said Archbishop James
      Beaton and his doctors, for none other crime but because he had a New Testament in English. More of his story we have
      not, except that he died constant, and with great patience, at St. Andrews. The flame of persecution ceased after his
      death for the space of ten years or thereby. Not that these bloody beasts ceased by all means to suppress the light
      of God, and to trouble such as in any sort were suspected to abhor their corruption; but because the realm was troubled
      with intestine and civil wars. In these, much blood was shed; first, at Melrose, betwixt the Douglas and Buccleuch,
      on the eighteenth day of July, in the year of God 1526; next, at Linlithgow, betwixt the Hamiltons and the Earl of
      Lennox, where the said Earl, with many others, lost his life, on the thirteenth day of September in the same year;
      and last, betwixt the King himself and the said Douglases, whom he banished from the realm, and held in exile during
      the rest of his days. By reason of these, and of other troubles, the bishops and their bloody bands could not find
      the time so favourable unto them as they required, for executing their tyranny.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p22.1">The Reformation in England.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p23" shownumber="no">In this mid time, the wisdom of God did provide that Harry the Eighth, King of England, should abolish from his realm the
      name and authority of the Pope of Rome, and suppress the Abbeys and other places of idolatry. This gave hope, in divers
      realms, that some godly reformation should have ensued therefrom. From this our country, divers learned men, and others
      that lived in fear of persecution, did repair to that realm. They found not such purity as they wished, and some of
      them sought other countries. But they escaped the tyranny of merciless men, and were reserved to better times, that
      they might fructify within His Church, in divers places and parts, and in divers vocations. Alexander Seton remained
      in England, and publicly, with great praise and comfort of many, taught the Evangel in all sincerity certain years.
      Albeit the craftiness of Winchester, and of others, circumvented the said Alexander, so as to cause him, at Paul's
      Cross, to affirm certain things repugnant to his<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_15">15</span> former true doctrine;
      there is no doubt but that, as God had powerfully reigned with him in all his life, in his death, which shortly after
      followed, he found the mercy of his God, whereupon he ever exhorted all men to depend.

      the University of Leipsic; and so was Master John Fyfe. There, for their honest behaviour and great erudition, they
      were held in admiration by all the godly. And in what honour, credit, and estimation, Dr. Macchabeus was with Christian
      King of Denmark, let Copenhagen and famous men of divers nations testify. Thus did God provide for His servants, and
      frustrate the expectation of these bloody beasts who, by the death of one in whom the light of God did clearly shine,
      intended to have suppressed Christ's truth for ever within this realm. But the contrary had God decreed; for his death
      was, as we have said, the cause of awakening many from the deadly sleep of ignorance; and so did Jesus Christ, the
      only true Light, shine unto many, from the away-taking of one. These notable men, Master John Fyfe only excepted, did
      never after comfort this country with their bodily presence; but God made them fructify in His Church, and raised them
      up lights out of darkness, to the praise of His own mercy, and to the just condemnation of them that then ruled—to
      wit, the King, Council, and nobility, yea, the whole people—who suffered such notable personages, without crimes committed,

      and John Stewart,<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_16">16</span> indwellers of Leith, with divers others, such as Master
      William Johnstone, and Master Henry Henderson, schoolmaster of Edinburgh. Some of these compeared in the Abbey Kirk

      brought to judgment, to wit, David Stratoun, a gentleman, and Master Norman Gourlay, a man of reasonable erudition.
      Of them we must shortly speak.

<p id="iii.i-p26" shownumber="no">In Master Norman appeared knowledge, albeit joined with weakness. But in David Stratoun there could only be espied, from
      the first, a hatred against the pride and avarice of the priests. The cause of his delation was as follows. He had
      made himself a fishing boat to go to sea, and the Bishop of Moray, then being Prior of St. Andrews, and his factors,
      urged for the teind thereof. His answer was that, if they would have teind of that which his servants won in the sea,
      it was but reason that they should come and receive it where he got the stock.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p26.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p26.1">24</a></sup>

      he had been a very stubborn man, and one that despised all reading, chiefly of those things that were godly. Miraculously,
      as it were, he appeared to be changed; for he delighted in nothing but in reading, albeit he himself could not read,
      and he became a vehement exhorter of all men to concord, to quietness, and to the contempt of the world. He frequented
      much the company of the Laird of Dun, whom God in those days had marvellously illuminated.

<p id="iii.i-p27" shownumber="no">One day, the present Laird of Lauriston, then a young man, was reading to him from the New Testament, in a certain quiet
      spot in the fields. As God had appointed, he chanced to read these sentences of our Master, Jesus Christ: "He that
      denies Me before men, or is ashamed of Me in the midst of this wicked generation, I will<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_17">17</span>      deny him in the presence of My Father, and before His angels." At these words he suddenly, being as one ravished, platt

After extending both hands and visage fixedly to the heavens for a reasonable time, he burst
      forth in these words: "O Lord, I have been wicked, and justly mayest Thou withdraw Thy grace from me. But, Lord, for
      Thy mercy's sake, let me never deny Thee or Thy truth, from fear of death or corporal pain."

<p id="iii.i-p28" shownumber="no">The issue declared that his prayer was not vain: for when he, with the foresaid Master Norman, was produced in judgment in
      the Abbey of Holyroodhouse, the King himself (all clad in red) being present, there was great labour to make the said
      David Stratoun recant, and burn his bill. But he, ever standing at his defence, alleging that he had not offended,
      in the end was adjudged unto the fire. When he perceived the danger, he asked grace of the King. This would the King
      willingly have granted unto him, but the bishops proudly answered that his hands were bound in that case, and that
      he had no grace to give to such as by their law were condemned. And so was David Stratoun, with the said Master Norman,
      after dinner, upon the twenty-seventh day of August, in the year of God 1534, led to a place beside the Rood of Greenside;
      and there these two were both hanged and burned, according to the mercy of the papistical Kirk.

      rebuked. Dundee and Leith were the principal centres of enlightenment, and there David Beaton, cruel Cardinal, made
      a very strait inquisition, divers being compelled to abjure and burn their bills, some in St. Andrews, and some at
      Edinburgh. About the same time, Captain John Borthwick was burnt in effigy, but by God's providence he himself escaped

      and some were accused. And yet ever did some light burst out in the midst of darkness; for the truth of Christ Jesus
      entered even into the cloisters, as well of Friars, as of Monks and Canons. John Linn, a Grey Friar, left his hypocritical
      habit and the den of those murderers the Grey Friars. A Black Friar, called Friar Kyllour, set forth the history of
      Christ's Passion in the form of a play, which he both preached and practised openly in Stirling, the King himself being
      present, upon a Good Friday in the morning. In this, all things were so lovably expressed that the very simple people
      understood, and these confessed that, as the priests and obstinate Pharisees persuaded the people to refuse Christ
      Jesus, and caused Pilate to condemn Him, so did the bishops and men called religious blind the people, and persuade
      princes and judges to persecute such as professed the blessed Evangel of Christ Jesus.

      Thomas Forret, Canon Regular and Vicar of Dollar, a man of upright life, were all together cruelly murdered in one

      the effect that the rest of the bishops might show themselves no less fervent to suppress the light of God than was
      he of St. Andrews. The one was Jerome Russell, a Cordelier Friar, a young man of a<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_19">19</span>      meek nature, quick spirit, and good letters. The other was one Kennedy, who was not more than eighteen years of age,
      and was of excellent ingyne<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p32.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p32.1">27</a></sup>

      hands in the blood of the saints of God, there were sent Master John Lauder, Master Andrew Oliphant, and Friar Maltman,
      sergeants of Satan, apt for that purpose. The day appointed for their cruelty having come, the two poor saints of God
      were presented before these bloody butchers. Grievous were the crimes that were laid to their charge.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p33" shownumber="no">At the first, Kennedy was faint, and gladly would have recanted. But, when a place of repentance was denied unto him, the
      Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of all comfort, began to work in him. The inward comfort began to burst forth, in
      visage as well as in tongue and word; for his countenance began to be cheerful. With a joyful voice he said, upon his
      knees, "O Eternal God! how wondrous is that love and mercy that Thou bearest unto mankind, and unto me the most caitiff
      and miserable wretch above all others; for, even now, when I would have denied Thee, and Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
      my only Saviour, and so have casten myself into everlasting damnation; Thou, by Thine own hand, hast pulled me from
      the very bottom of hell, and makest me to feel that heavenly comfort which takes from me the ungodly fear wherewith
      before I was oppressed. Now I defy death; do what ye please, I praise my God I am ready."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p34" shownumber="no">The godly and learned Jerome, railed upon by those godless tyrants, answered, "This is your hour and that of the power of
      darkness: now sit ye as judges; and we stand wrongfully accused, and more wrongfully to be condemned; but the day shall
      come, when our innocency shall appear, and ye shall see your own blindness, to your everlasting confusion. Go forward,
      and fulfil the measure of your iniquity."

      reproach were sent unto the King, and also unto his Council. King Harry frustrated, returned to London; and, after
      declaring his indignation, began to fortify with men his frontiers<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_23">23</span> fornent

Sir Robert Bowes, the Earl of Angus, and his brother, Sir George Douglas, were sent to the Borders. Upon
      what other trifling questions, as, for example, the Debateable Land and such like, the war broke out, we omit to write.
      The principal occasion was the falsifying of the promise. Our King, perceiving that the war would rise, asked the prelates
      and kirkmen what support they would make to the sustaining of the same; for rather he would yet satisfy the desire
      of his uncle than would he hazard war, when he saw that his forces were not able to resist. The kirkmen promised mountains
      of gold, as Satan their father did to Christ Jesus if He would worship him. They would have gone to hell, rather than
      that he should have met with King Harry: for then, thought they, farewell our kingdom; and, thought the Cardinal, farewell
      his credit and glory in France. In the end, they promised fifty thousand crowns a year, to be well paid, so long as
      the wars lasted; and further, that their servants, and others that appertained unto them and were exempt from common
      service, should not the less serve in time of necessity.

      men were laid in Jedburgh and Kelso. All men, fools we mean, bragged of victory; and in very deed the beginning gave
      us a fair show. For at the first warden raid, which was made on St. Bartholomew's Day, in the year of God 1542, the
      Warden, Sir Robert Bowes, his brother Richard Bowes, Captain of Norham, Sir William Mowbray, knight, a bastard son
      of the Earl of Angus, and James Douglas of Parkhead, then rebels, with a great number of borderers, soldiers, and gentlemen,
      were taken. The Raid was termed Halden Rig. The Earl of Angus, and Sir George his brother, did narrowly escape. Our
      papists and priests, proud of this victory, encouraged the King. There was nothing heard but, "All is ours. They are
      but heretics. If we be a thousand and they ten thousand, they dare not fight. France shall enter the one part, and
      we the other, and so shall England be<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_24">24</span> conquered within a year." If any

      and tended to the west, ever holding Tweed upon their one side, and never camping more than a mile from that river
      during the whole time they continued in Scotland, which was ten or twelve days. Day forays were run to Smailholm, Stitchel,

They burned some corn, besides that which the great host consumed, but they carried away small booty. The
      King assembled his force at Fala, for he had information that they had proposed to advance on Edinburgh. Taking the
      muster all at one hour, two days before Halloween, there were found with him eighteen thousand able men. Ten thousand
      men, with the Earl of Huntly and Lords Erskine, Seton and Home, were upon the borders, awaiting the English army. These

      invading England, neither had they so just title as they desired, nor could they be then able to do anything to the
      hurt of England, considering that they had now been long absent from their houses, their provisions were spent, their
      horses were wearied, and, greatest of all, the time of year did utterly forbid. This answer seemed to satisfy the King;

      Long had he governed as he himself chose, and he decreed a notable revenge. This, no doubt, he would not have failed
      to have executed had not God, by His own hand, cut the cords of his impiety. He returned to Edinburgh; and the nobility,
      barons, gentlemen, and commons dispersed to their own habitations. This was on the second and third days of November.

<p id="iii.i-p48" shownumber="no">Without delay, at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, a new Council was convened, a Council, we mean, of the abusers of the King.
      There accusation was laid against the most part of the nobility. Some were heretics, some favourers of England, some
      friends to the Douglases, and so could there be none faithful to the King, in their opinion. The Cardinal and the priests
      cast faggots in the fire with all their force. Finding the King wholly given over to their devotion, they delivered
      unto him a scroll containing the names of such as they, in their inquisition, deemed heretics. For this was the order
      of justice kept by these holy fathers in damning innocent men. Whosoever would delate any one of heresy was<span class="pb"
            id="iii.i-Page_26">26</span> heard; no respect or consideration was taken as to what mind the delater bare to the person
      delated. Whosoever were produced as witnesses were admitted, however suspicious and infamous they were. If two or three
      had proven any point that by their law was holden heresy, the delated person was a heretic. There remained no more
      to be done but to fix a day for his condemnation, and for the execution of their corrupt sentence. The world may this
      day consider what man could be innocent where such judges were party. True it is that by false judgment and false witnesses
      innocents have been oppressed from the beginning. But never gat the Devil his freedom to shed innocent blood except
      in the kingdom of Antichrist, "that the innocent should die, and neither know accuser nor yet the witnesses that testified
      against him." But how shall the Antichrist be known, if he be not contrarious to God the Father and His Son, Christ

      gave answer in the Palace of Holyroodhouse to the Cardinal and prelates, when they had uttered their malice and shown
      what profit might arise to the crown if he would follow their counsel. "Pack you, Jesuits; get you to your charges,
      reform your own lives, and be not instruments of discord betwixt my nobility and me; or else, I avow to God, I shall

      than it was accepted, with no small regret made by the King's own mouth that he had so long despised their counsel;
      "For," said he, "now I plainly see your words to be true. The nobility desire neither my honour nor continuance; they
      would not ride a mile for my pleasure to follow my enemies. Will ye therefore find me the means whereby I may have
      a raid made into England, without their knowledge and consent—a raid that may be known as my own raid—and I shall bind
      me to your counsel for ever." There concurred together Ahab and his false prophets; there were congratulations and
      clapping of hands; there were promises of diligence, closeness, and felicity.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p52" shownumber="no">Finally, conclusion was taken that the west border of England, which was most empty of men and garrisons, should be invaded;
      the King's own banner should be there; Oliver, the great minion, should be general lieutenant; but no man should be
      privy of the enterprise, except the council that was then present, until the very day and execution thereof. The Bishops
      gladly took the charge of that raid. Letters were sent to such as they would charge to meet the King, on a day and
      at a place appointed. The Cardinal was directed to go with the Earl of Arran to Haddington, to make a show against
      the east border, when the others were in readiness to invade the west. And thus neither counsel, practice, closeness,
      nor diligence lacked to set forward that enterprise. And, among these consulters, there was no doubt of a good success.
      So was the scroll thankfully received by the King himself, and put into his own pocket, where it remained to the day
      of his death, and then was found. In it were contained the names of more than a hundred landed men, besides others
      of meaner degree. Amongst these, the Lord Hamilton himself, then second person of the realm, was delated.

      companies from all quarters, as they were appointed, no man knowing of another. No general proclamation had been made;
      all had been summoned by privy letters. Nor did the multitude know anything of the purpose until after midnight, when

      an army of ten thousand men, and their corn and houses upon every side sending flames of fire unto the heaven. To them
      it was more than a wonder that such a multitude could have been assembled and convoyed, without knowledge thereof coming
      to their wardens. They looked not for support, and so at the first they utterly despaired. Yet began they to assemble
      together, ten in one company, twenty in another; and, as the fray proceeded, their troops increased, but to no number;
      for Carlisle, fearing to have been assaulted, suffered no man to issue from the gates. Thus the greatest number that
      ever appeared or approached before the discomfiture, did not exceed three or four hundred men; and yet they made hot

      softly retire towards Scotland, and that the horsemen should take horse again, and follow in order. Great was the noise

      against Scotland? In the former discomfiture, two hundred and thirty persons in the skirmish, with seven thousand following
      them in the great battle, did put to flight the said Benhadad, with thirty kings in his company. But here, in this

      of His working, nor yet of the causes thereof; no more than did the wall that fell upon the rest of Benhadad's army

      against pride for the freedom of His own little flock, unjustly persecuted, do willingly and maliciously obscure the

<p id="iii.i-p60" shownumber="no">The King waited upon news at Lochmaben, and when the certain knowledge of the discomfiture came to his ears he was stricken
      with a sudden fear and astonishment, so that scarcely could he speak, or hold purposed converse with any man. The night
      constrained him to remain where he was, and so he went to bed; but he rose without rest or quiet sleep. His continual
      complaint was, "Oh, fled Oliver! Is Oliver ta'en? Oh, fled Oliver!" These words in his melancholy, and as if he were
      carried away in a trance, he repeated from time to time, to the very hour of his death. Upon the morn, which was St.
      Katherine's Day, he returned to Edinburgh, as did the Cardinal from Haddington. But the one being ashamed of the other,

      Laird of Grange, and some others that waited upon his chamber. At supper, the lady, perceiving him pensive, began to
      comfort him, and urged him to take the work of God in good part. "My portion of this world is short," he replied, "for
      I will not be with you fifteen days." His servants, repairing unto him, asked where he would have provision made for
      Yuletide, which then approached. He answered with a disdainful smirk, "I cannot tell: choose ye the place. But this

      to bed. No sign of death appeared about him, but he constantly affirmed that, before such a day, he would be dead.

      of her whole life to this day hath declared. The certainty that a daughter was born unto him coming to his ears, the
      King turned from such as spake with him, and said, "The devil go with it! It will end as it began: it came from a woman;

      "Take order, Sire, with your realm: who shall rule during the minority of your daughter? Ye have known my service,
      what will ye have done? Shall there not be four regents chosen, and shall not I be principal of them?" Whatsoever the

      dead man's hand was made to subscribe a blank, that they might write above the signature what pleased them best. This
      finished, the Cardinal posted to the Queen. At the first sight of the Cardinal, she said, "Welcome, my Lord. Is not
      the King dead?" Divers men are of divers opinions as to what moved her so to conjecture. Many whisper that of old his
      part was in the pot, and that the suspicion thereof caused him to be inhibited the Queen's company. Howsoever it may
      have been before, it is plain that, after the King's death, and during the Cardinal's life, whosoever might guide the

      of men began to be disclosed. All men lamented that the realm was left without a male to succeed; yet some rejoiced
      that such an enemy to God's truth was taken away. By some he was called a good poor-man's king; by others he was termed
      a murderer of the nobility, and one that had decreed their utter destruction. Some praised him for suppressing theft
      and oppression; others dispraised him for the defiling of men's wives and of virgins. Men spake as affection led them.
      And yet none spake altogether beside the truth; for all these things were in part so manifest that, as the virtues

<p id="iii.i-p64" shownumber="no">Throughout this realm the question of government was universally moved. The Cardinal proclaimed the King's last will. Therein
      were nominated four Protectors or Regents, of whom he himself was the first and principal, with him being joined the
      Earls Huntly, Argyll, and Moray. This was done on the Monday at the Market Cross of Edinburgh. But on the Monday following
      the whole Regents had remission from their usurpation. By the stout and wise counsel of the Laird of Grange, the Earl
      of Arran, then second person to the Crown, caused assemble the nobility of the realm, and required the equity of their
      judgment in his just suit to be governor of this realm during the minority of her to whom he would succeed, in the
      event of her death without lawful succession. His friends convened, the nobility assembled, and the day of decision
      was appointed. The Cardinal and his faction opposed themselves to the government of one man, and especially to the
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_34">34</span> regiment of any called Hamilton: "For who knows not," said the Cardinal,
      "that the Hamiltons are cruel murderers, oppressors of innocence, proud, avaricious, double, and false; and, finally,
      the pestilence in this commonwealth." Thereto the said Earl answered, "Defraud me not of my right, and call me what
      ye please. Whatsoever my friends have been, unto this day no man has had cause to complain upon me, nor am I minded
      to flatter any of my friends in their evil doing. By God's grace I shall be as forward to correct their enormities
      as any within the realm can reasonably require of me. And therefore, yet again, my Lords, in God's name I crave that
      ye do me no wrong, nor defraud me of my just title, before ye have experience of my government." At these words, all
      that feared God or loved honesty were so moved that with one voice they cried, "That petition is most just, and unless
      we would act against God, justice, and equity, it cannot be denied."

      was before, so long as he abode in God. Great favour was borne unto him, because it was bruited that he favoured God's
      Word; and because it was well known that he was one appointed to have been persecuted, as the scroll, found in the
      King's pocket after his death, did witness. These two things, together with an opinion that men had of his simplicity,
      did, in the beginning, bow unto him the hearts of many who afterwards, with dolour of heart, were compelled to change
      their opinions. We omit a variety of matters, such as the order taken for keeping the young Queen; the provision for

<p id="iii.i-p67" shownumber="no">The Governor being established in government, godly men repaired unto him, and exhorted him to call to mind for what end
      God had exalted him; out of what danger He had delivered him; and what expectation all men of honesty had of him. At
      their suit, more than of his own motion, Thomas Williams, a Black Friar, was called to be preacher. The man was of
      solid judgment, reasonable letters for that age, and of a prompt and good utterance: his doctrine was wholesome, without
      great vehemence against superstition. John Rough, who after, for the truth of Christ Jesus, suffered in England, in
      the days of Mary of cursed memory, preached also sometimes, not so learnedly, yet more simply, and more vehemently
      against all impiety. The doctrine of these two provoked against them and against the Governor the hatred of all that
      favoured darkness more than light, and their own bellies more than God. These slaves of Satan, the Grey Friars (and
      amongst the rest Friar Scott, who before had given himself forth for the greatest professor of Christ Jesus within
      Scotland, and under that colour had disclosed and so endangered many) croaked like ravens, yea, rather they yelled

<p id="iii.i-p69" shownumber="no">At the approach of Parliament before Easter, there began to be question of abolishing certain tyrannical acts, formerly made
      at the instance of the prelates, for maintaining of their kingdom of darkness; to wit, the Act "that under pain of
      heresy, no man should read any part of the Scriptures in the English tongue, nor yet any tractate or exposition of
      any place of Scripture." Such articles began to come into question, we say, and men began to inquire if it was not
      as lawful to men that understood no Latin to use the Word of their salvation in the tongue they understood, as it was
      for Latin men to have it in Latin, and for Greeks or Hebrews to have it in their tongues. It was answered that the
      first Kirk had forbidden all tongues but these three. But men demanded when that inhibition was given; and what Council
      had ordained that, considering that Chrysostom complained that the people used not the Psalms, and other holy books,
      in their own tongues? If it be said that these were Greeks, and understood the Greek tongue, we answer that Christ
      Jesus commanded His Word to be preached to all nations. Now, if it ought to be preached to all nations, it must be
      preached in the tongue they understand. If it be lawful to preach it and to hear it preached in all tongues, why should
      it not be lawful to read it, and to hear it read in all tongues, to the end that the people may try the spirits, according
      to the commandment of the Apostle.

<p id="iii.i-p70" shownumber="no">Beaten with these and other reasons, it was admitted that the Word might be read in the vulgar tongue, provided that the

      and New Testament, together with the benefit of other tracts containing wholesome doctrine, until such time as the
      prelates and kirkmen should give and set forth unto them a translation more correct." The clergy hereto long repugned;
      but, in the end, convicted by reason and by multitude of contrary votes, they also acquiesced. So, by Act of Parliament,
      it was made free to all men and women to read the Scriptures in their own tongue, or in the English tongue; and all

      almost every gentleman's table. The New Testament was borne about in many men's hands. We grant that some, alas! profaned
      that blessed Word; for some that, perchance, had never read ten sentences in it had it most commonly in their hands.
      They would chop their familiars on the cheek with it, and say, "This has lain hid under my bed-foot these ten years."
      Others would glory, "Oh! how often have I been in danger for this book. How secretly have I stolen from my wife at

      heaven He had declared His good pleasure in that proposal. For, to King Harry, Jane Seymour (after the death of Queen
      Katherine, and of all others that might have made his marriage suspect) had borne a son, Edward the Sixth of blessed
      memory, older some years than our Mistress, and unto us was left a Queen. This wonderful providence of God caused men
      of greatest judgment to enter into disputation with themselves, whether, with good conscience, any man might repugn
      to the desires of the King of England, considering that thereby all occasion of war might be cut off, and great commodity
      might ensue to his realm. The offers of King Harry were so large and his demands were so reasonable that all that loved
      quietness were content therewith. There were sent from the Parliament to King Harry, in commission, Sir William Hamilton,
      Sir James Learmonth, and Mr. Henry Balnaves. These remained long in England, and so travailed that all things concerning
      the marriage betwixt Edward the Sixth and Mary Queen of Scots were agreed upon, except the time of her deliverance

      pacification was made for that time. By the judgment of eight persons for either party, chosen to judge whether anything
      had been done by the Ambassadors, in contracting that marriage, for which they had not sufficient power from the Council
      and Parliament, it was found that all things had been done by them according to their commission, and that these should

      The bruit of the learning and honest life of these two, and of their fervency and uprightness in religion, was such
      that there was great hope that their presence should have been comfortable to the Kirk of God. It was constantly affirmed
      that, without delay, the one and the other would occupy the pulpit, and truly preach Jesus Christ. Few days disclosed
      their hypocrisy. What terrors, what promises, or what enchanting boxes they brought from France, the common people
      knew not, but shortly after it was seen that Friar Williams was inhibited from preaching, and so departed to England.

<p id="iii.i-p78" shownumber="no">The men of counsel, judgment, and godliness that had travailed to promote the Governor, and that gave him faithful counsel
      in all doubtful matters, were either craftily conveyed from him, or else, by threats of hanging, were compelled to
      leave him. Of the former number were the Laird of Grange, Master Henry Balnaves, Master Thomas Bellenden, and Sir David
      Lyndsay of the Mount; men by whose labours the Governor was promoted to honour, and by whose counsel he so used himself
      at the beginning that the obedience given to him was nothing inferior to that possessed by any king of Scotland for
      many years before. Yea, it did surmount the common obedience, in that it proceeded from love of those virtues that
      were supposed to have been in him. Of the number of those that were threatened were Master Michael<span class="pb"
            id="iii.i-Page_41">41</span> Durham, Master David Borthwick, David Forrest, and David Bothwell. These had counselled
      the Governor to have in his company God-fearing men, and not to foster wicked men in their iniquity, albeit they were
      called his friends and were of his surname. When this counsel came to the ears of the foresaid Abbot and the Hamiltons,
      who then repaired to the Court as ravens to the carrion, it was said in plain words, "My Lord Governor and his friends
      will never be in quietness, until a dozen of these knaves that abuse his Grace be hanged."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p79" shownumber="no">These words were spoken in his own presence, and in the presence of some of them that had better deserved than so to have
      been entreated. The speaker was allowed his bold and plain speaking, and the wicked counsel being tolerated, honest
      and godly men left the Court and the Governor in the hands of such as led him so far from God that he falsified his
      promise, dipped his hands in the blood of the saints of God, and brought this commonwealth to the very point of utter
      ruin. These were the first-fruits of the godliness and learning of the Abbot of Paisley: hereafter we will hear more.

      the dangers that might ensue the alteration and change of religion; the power of the King of France; and the commodity
      that might come to him and his house by retaining the ancient league with France. He was also called on to consider
      the great danger that he brought upon himself if, in any jot, he suffered the authority of the Pope to be violated
      or called in question within this realm; for thereon alone stood the security of his right to the succession of the
      Crown of this realm. By God's Word, the divorcement of his father from Elizabeth Home, his first wife, would not be
      found lawful, his second marriage would be judged null, and he himself declared bastard. Caiaphas spake prophecy, and
      wist not what he spake; for at that time there were no men that truly feared God that minded any such thing. With their
      whole force they would have fortified the title that God had given unto him, and things done in time of darkness would
      never have been called in question.

      draw to his faction or corrupt by any means, seeking thereby to raise a party against the said Governor, and against
      such as stood fast for the contract of marriage and peace with England. The said Cardinal, the Earls Argyll, Huntly,
      and Bothwell, and the bishops and their bands, assembled at Linlithgow: thereafter they passed to Stirling, and took
      with them both the Queens, the mother and the daughter, and threatened the deposition of the said Governor, as inobedient

      Governor might be called back to his former godly purpose, and that he would not do so foolishly and inhonestly, yea

      King, by the Cardinal's advice, promised to pronounce bastard, and so make the said Earl Governor. The Cardinal further
      put the Earl in vain hope that the Queen Dowager would marry him. He brought with him some money, and more he afterwards
      received from the hands of La Broche. But, at length, perceiving himself frustrated of all expectation that he had
      either from the King of France, or yet from the promise of the Cardinal, he concluded to seek the favour of England,
      and began to draw a faction against the Governor.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p87" shownumber="no">In hatred of the other's inconstancy, many favoured him in the beginning. At Yule there assembled in the town of Ayr, the
      Earls of Angus, Glencairn, and Cassillis, the Lords Maxwell and Somerville, the Laird of Drumlanrig, and the Sheriff
      of Ayr, with all the force that they and the Lords that remained constant to England might make. After Yule they came
      to Leith. The Governor and Cardinal, with their forces, kept Edinburgh, for they were slackly pursued. Men excused
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_44">44</span> the Earl of Lennox in this matter, and laid the blame upon some that
      had no good will towards the regiment of the Stuarts. However it was, the said Earl of Lennox was disappointed of his
      purpose, and narrowly escaped; and first got himself to Glasgow, and after that to Dumbarton. Sir George Douglas was
      delivered to be kept as pledge. The Earl his brother was taken at the siege of Glasgow in the following Lent. It was

<p id="iii.i-p88" shownumber="no">After the Cardinal had got the Governor wholly under his control, and had obtained his desires concerning a part of his enemies,
      he began to practise that such as he feared and therefore hated should be set by the ears, one against another. In
      that, thought the carnal man, stood his greatest security. The Lord Ruthven he hated, by reason of his knowledge of
      God's Word: the Lord Gray he feared, because at that time he sought the company of such as professed godliness, and
      bare small favour to the Cardinal. Now the worldly-wise man reasoned thus: "If I can put enmity betwixt those two,
      I shall be quit of a great number of unfriends; for the most part of the country will either assist the one or the
      other; and, otherwise occupied, they will not watch for my displeasure." Without long process, he found the necessary
      means; for he laboured with John Charteris, a man of stout courage and many friends, to accept the provostship of Perth,
      which he purchased<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p88.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p88.1">54</a></sup>

      only the said Lord Ruthven, but also the town was offended. These gave a negative answer, alleging that such intrusion
      of men into office was hurtful to their privilege and freedom. This granted unto them free election of their provost
      from year to year, at a certain time appointed, and this they could not or would not prevent.

      Gray, with Norman Leslie, and with other friends. These he easily persuaded to assist him in that pursuit, because
      he appeared to have the Governor's right, and had not only a charge to the town, but also had purchased letters empowering
      him to besiege it and to take it by strong hand, if any resistance were made unto him. These letters made many favour
      his action. The other party made for defence, and the Master of Ruthven (the Lord that afterwards departed to England)
      undertook the maintenance of the town, having in his company the Laird of Moncrieffe, and other neighbouring friends.

<p id="iii.i-p90" shownumber="no">The said John made frack for the pursuit; and upon the Magdalene's day, in the morning, anno 1543, approached with his forces,
      the Lord Gray taking upon him the principal charge. Norman Leslie, with his friends, should have come by ship, with
      munition and ordnance, and they were in readiness. But because the tide served not soon, the other, thinking himself
      of sufficient force for all that were in the town, entered by the bridge. They found no resistance until the foremost
      were well within the Fish Gate, when the Master of Ruthven, with his company, stoutly rencountered them, and so rudely
      repulsed them that such as were behind gave back. The place of the retreat was so strait, that men durst not fight,
      and could not flee at their pleasure, for Lord Gray and his friends were upon the bridge. The slaughter was great;
      for there fell by the edge of the sword threescore men. The Cardinal had rather that the unhap had fallen on the other
      side; but, howsoever it was, he thought that such trouble was for his comfort and advantage. The knowledge of this
      came unto the ears of the party that had received the discomfiture, and was unto them no small grief. Many of them
      had entered into that action for his pleasure, and thought they should have had his fortification and assistance. Finding
      themselves frustrated, they began to look more narrowly to themselves, and did not so much attend upon the Cardinal's
      devotion, as they had been wont to do. Thus was a new jealousy engendered amongst them; for whosoever would<span class="pb"

      for that purpose assembled their folks at Balgavie. They were more than three hundred men, and the Cardinal, informed
      of their number, thought it not good that they should join with the town, for he feared his own estate; and so he persuaded
      the Governor to pass forth from Dundee before nine o'clock, and to take the straight road to Perth. The Lords, perceiving
      this, began to fear that they were come to pursue them, and so put themselves in order and array, and marched forward

      and consultation was taken as to how the force of the others might be broken. And at the first, the Laird of Grange
      and the Provost of St. Andrews, knowing nothing of treason, were sent to ask, "Why they molested my Lord Governor in
      his journey?" Thereto they answered that "nothing was less their intention; for they had come at his Grace's commandment,
      to keep the hour in Dundee appointed by him. When they saw this prevented, and knew the Cardinal to be their unfriend,
      they could not but suspect their coming forth of the town contrary to previous arrangement. They had therefore put
      themselves in order, not to invade, but to defend in case they were invaded." This answer being reported, there was
      sent to them the Archbishop of St. Andrews, Master David Panter, and the Lairds of Buccleuch and Coldinknowes, to desire
      certain of the other company to talk with them. This was easily obtained, for they suspected no treason. After long
      communication, it was demanded whether the Earl and Lord and<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_47">47</span> Master Henry
      foresaid would not be content to talk with the Governor, provided that the Cardinal and his company were off the ground?
      They answered that the Governor might command them in all things lawful, but that they had no will to be at the Cardinal's
      mercy. Fair enough promises were made for their security. Then the Cardinal and his band were commanded to depart;
      and, according to the purpose taken, he did so.

<p id="iii.i-p93" shownumber="no">The Governor remained, and another with him; and, without company, the said Earl, Lord, and Master Henry came to him. After

      the Cardinal had ridden. When it was too late, they began to suspect, and desired to have returned to their folk. But
      it was answered, "They should send back from the town, but they must needs go forward with my Lord Governor." And so,
      partly by flattery and partly by force, they were compelled to obey. As soon as ever they were within the town they
      were apprehended, and upon the morn all three were sent to Black Ness. There they remained so long as it pleased the

      in regard to the cruel deed at Perth is this. On St. Paul's Day, before the first burning in Edinburgh, the Governor

      suspicion that they had eaten a goose upon Friday, four men were adjudged to be hanged, and a woman to be drowned;
      and this cruel and most unjust sentence was unmercifully put into execution. The husband was hanged, and the wife,
      having a sucking babe upon her breast, was drowned. "O Lord, the land is not yet purged from such beastly cruelty;

      This was upon the Saturday, before<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_49">49</span> noon. Some said there was no doubt

      the men-of-war that shall land in Scotland." The Cardinal sat still at his dinner, as if there had been no apparent
      danger. Men ran together to gaze upon the ships, some to the Castle Hill, some to the Crags and other eminent places.
      But no one asked what forces we had for resistance, if we should be invaded. Soon after six o'clock at night, more
      than two hundred sails were arrived and had cast anchor in the Road of Leith. Shortly thereafter, the Admiral shot
      a fleet boat, and this sounded the depth of water from Granton crags unto the east of Leith, and then returned to her
      ship. Men of judgment foresaw what this meant. But no credit was given to any that said, "They mind to land." And so

      a galley or two laid their snouts to the crags. The small ships, called pinnaces and light horsemen, approached as
      near as they could. The great ships discharged their soldiers into the smaller vessels, and these, by boats, set upon
      dry land, before ten o'clock, ten thousand men, as was judged, and more. The Governor and Cardinal, seeing then what
      they could not, or at least would not, believe before, after they had made a brag to fight, fled as fast as horse would

      gentle masters of England."

      towards the town of Edinburgh, spoiled and burnt the same, and also the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The horsemen took
      the House of Craigmillar, and got great spoil therein; for, it being judged the strongest house near the town, other
      than the Castle of Edinburgh, men sought to place their movables therein for safety. But the courageous Laird gave
      it over without shot of hackbut, and for his reward was caused to march upon foot to London. He is now captain of Dunbar

      was to their own discomfiture; for, without trench or gabion, they were exposed to the force of the whole ordnance
      of the said Castle. This opened fire, and not all in vain; for the wheel and axletree of one of the English cannons
      were broken, and some of their men were slain. So, with small honour, they left off that enterprise, which was taken
      in rashness rather than of any advised counsel. When for the most part of the day the English had spoiled and burned,
      they returned to Leith towards the night; upon the morrow returning to Edinburgh, and executing the rest of God's judgments
      for that time. When they had consumed both towns, they laded the ships with spoil thereof, and returned to Berwick
      by land, using the country for the most part at their own pleasure.

      was in extreme calamity; for divers strongholds, such as Carlaverock, Lochmaben, and Langholm, were delivered to the

      came to Scotland, in the year of God 1544, that blessed martyr of God, Master George Wishart, in company of the commissioners
      before mentioned. A man of such graces was never before him heard of within this realm; yea, and such graces are yet
      rarely found in any man, notwithstanding the great light of God that since his days has shined upon us. He was not
      only singularly learned, as well in godly knowledge as in all honest human science, but he was also so clearly illuminated
      with the spirit of prophecy that he saw not only things pertaining to himself, but also such things as some towns and
      the whole realm afterwards felt. These he forespake, not in secret, but in the audience of many, as in their own places
      shall be declared.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p104.1">He is driven from Dundee.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p105" shownumber="no">He began teaching in Montrose. Thence he went to Dundee, where, with great admiration of all that heard him, he taught the
      Epistle to the Romans, until, by procurement of the Cardinal, Robert Mill, then one of the principal men in Dundee,
      and a man that of old had professed knowledge and for the same had suffered trouble, did, in the Queen's and Governor's
      name, give inhibition to the said Master George that he should trouble their town no more; for they would not suffer
      it. This was said unto him in the public place. After musing for some time, with his eyes bent to heaven, he looked
      sorrowfully to the speaker and to the people, and said, "God is witness that I never minded your trouble but your comfort.
      Yea, your trouble is more dolorous unto me, than it is unto yourselves. But I am assured that the refusal of God's

I have offered unto you the Word of salvation, and at the hazard of my life I have remained
      amongst you. Now ye yourselves refuse me, and therefore must I leave my innocency to be declared by my God. If it be
      long prosperous with you, I am not led by the Spirit of truth. But if trouble unlooked for apprehend you, do ye acknowledge
      the cause, and turn to God, for He is merciful. If ye turn not at the first, He shall visit you with fire and sword."
      These words pronounced, he came down from the preaching place.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p105.2">Master George goes to Kyle.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p106" shownumber="no">The Lord Marischall and divers gentlemen were present in the kirk, and these would have had the said Master George remain,
      or else have gone with him into the country. But for no request would he any longer tarry, either in the town or on
      that side of Tay. With all possible expedition he passed to the west-land, where he began to offer God's Word. This
      was gladly received by many, until Dunbar, Archbishop of Glasgow, by instigation of the Cardinal, came with his gatherings
      to the town of Ayr, to make resistance to the said Master George, and did first occupy the kirk. The Earl of Glencairn
      being informed of this, repaired with diligence to the town with his friends, and so did divers gentlemen of Kyle (amongst
      whom was the Laird of Leifnorris, a man far different from him that now liveth, in manners and religion) of whom to
      this day many yet live, and have declared themselves always zealous and bold in the cause of God. When all were assembled,
      conclusion was taken that they would have possession of the kirk. But Master George utterly repugned, saying, "Let
      him alone; his sermon will not do much hurt. Let us go to the Market Cross." This they did, and there he made so notable
      a sermon that the very enemies themselves were confounded. The Archbishop preached to his jackmen and some old bosses
      of the town. The sum of all his sermon was: "They say that we should preach: why not? Better late thrive than never
      thrive: hold us still for your Bishop, and we shall provide better for the next time." This was the beginning and the
      end of the Archbishop's sermon. With haste he departed from the town, nor did he return to fulfil his promise.

<p id="iii.i-p107" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_54">54</span></p>
<p id="iii.i-p108" shownumber="no">The said Master George remained with the gentlemen in Kyle, until he should get sure knowledge of the state of Dundee. He
      preached commonly at the kirk of Galston and much in the Barr. He was required to come to the kirk of Mauchline, and
      did so. But the Sheriff of Ayr manned the kirk, for preservation of a tabernacle that was there, beautiful to the eye.
      The persons that held the kirk were George Campbell of Monkgarswood, who yet liveth, Mungo Campbell of Brounsyde, George
      Reid in Daldilling, and the Laird of Templeland.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p109" shownumber="no">Some zealous men of the parish, among whom was Hugh Campbell of Kinyeancleuch, offended that they should be debarred their
      parish kirk, determined to enter by force. But the said Master George drew the said Hugh aside, and said unto him,
      "Brother, Christ Jesus is as potent upon the fields as in the kirk; and I find that He Himself preached in the desert,
      at the sea side, and other places judged profane, more often than He did in the Temple of Jerusalem. It is the word
      of peace that God sends by me; the blood of no man shall be shed this day for the preaching of it." And so, withdrawing
      the whole people, he came to a dyke at the side of a moor, upon the south-west side of Mauchline, and upon this he
      climbed. The whole multitude stood and sat about him, God giving a pleasing and hot day. He continued in preaching
      more than three hours. In that sermon, God wrought so wonderfully with him that one of the most wicked men that was
      in that country, Lawrence Rankin, Laird of Sheill, was converted. The tears ran from his eyes in such abundance that
      all men wondered. His conversion was without hypocrisy, for his life and conversation witnessed it in all after-times.

</div>
<p id="iii.i-p110" shownumber="no">While this faithful servant of God was thus occupied in Kyle, word came that the plague of pestilence had arisen in Dundee.
      This had begun within four days after Master George was inhibited from preaching, and was so vehement that it almost
      passed credibility to hear what number died every four-and-twenty hours. This certainly understood, Master George took
      his leave of Kyle, with the regret of many. No request could make him remain. "They are now in trouble," he said, "and
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_55">55</span> they need comfort. Perchance this hand of God will make them now to magnify
      and reverence that Word, which before, for the fear of men, they set at light price." On his coming to Dundee, the
      joy of the faithful was exceeding great. He delayed no time, but even upon the morrow gave signification that he would
      preach. The most part were either sick or were in company with those that were sick, and for this reason he chose the
      head of the East Port of the town for his preaching place. Those who were whole sat or stood within the Port, the sick
      and suspected without. The text of his first sermon was taken from the hundred-and-seventh Psalm, "He sent His Word
      and healed them;" joining therewith these words, "It is neither herb nor plaster, O Lord, but Thy Word healeth all."
      In this sermon he most comfortingly treated of the dignity and utility of God's Word; the punishment that comes for
      contempt of the same; the promptitude of God's mercy to such as truly turn to Him; yea, the great happiness of them
      whom God takes from this misery, even in His own gentle visitation, a happiness that the malice of man can neither
      eke nor pare.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p110.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p110.1">68</a></sup>

      more happy that should depart, than such as should remain behind; considering that they knew not if they should have
      such a comforter with them at all times. Master George did not hesitate to visit them that lay in the very extremity
      of sickness. Them he comforted as well as he might in such a multitude. He also caused that all things necessary for
      those that could use meat or drink should be ministered; and in that respect the town was wondrously benefited; for
      the poor were no more neglected than were the rich.

<p id="iii.i-p112" shownumber="no">While Master George Wishart was spending his life to comfort the afflicted, the Devil ceased not to stir up his own son the

      did not look to himself in all things so circumspectly as worldly men would<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_56">56</span>      have wished. One day, the sermon ended, and the people departing, suspecting no danger and therefore not heeding the
      said Master George, the priest that was corrupted stood waiting at the foot of the steps, his gown loose, and his drawn
      whinger in his hand under his gown. The said Master George, who was most sharp of eye and judgment, marked him, and
      as he came near said, "My friend, what would ye do?" Therewith he clapped his hand upon the priest's hand wherein the
      whinger was, and took this from him. The priest, abashed, fell down at his feet and openly confessed the truth. The
      noise coming to the ears of the sick, they cried, "Deliver the traitor to us, or else we will take him by force;" and
      burst in at the gate. But Master George took him in his arms and said, "Whosoever troubles him shall trouble me. He
      has hurt me in nothing, but has done great comfort both to you and me, he has let us understand what we may fear in
      times to come. We will watch better." Thus he appeased both the one part and the other, and saved the life of him that
      sought his.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p113" shownumber="no">When the plague was so ceased that there were almost none sick, Master George took his leave of the people of Dundee; saying
      that God had almost put end to that battle, and he found himself called to another. The gentlemen of the west had written
      unto him that he should meet them at Edinburgh; for they would demand disputation with the bishops, and he should be
      publicly heard. Thereto he willingly agreed; but first he passed to Montrose to salute the kirk there. There he remained,
      occupied sometimes in preaching but for the most part in secret meditation, in which he was so earnest that he would

      for his despatch. The letter coming to his hand, he made haste at the first, for the boy had brought a horse; and so
      with some honest men, he passed forth of the town. But suddenly he stayed and, musing a space, turned back. "I will
      not go," he said; "I am forbidden by God. I am assured there is treason. Let some of you go to yonder place, and tell
      me what ye find." Diligence made, they found the treason, as it was; and this being shown with expedition to Master
      George, he answered, "I know that I shall finish my life in that bloodthirsty man's hands; but it will not be in this
      manner."

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p114.2">The Agony of Master George Wishart.

<p id="iii.i-p115" shownumber="no">When the time at which he had appointed to meet the gentlemen at Edinburgh approached, Master George took his leave of Montrose,
      and, sorely against the judgment of the Laird of Dun, entered on his journey. He returned to Dundee, but did not remain,
      going on to the house of a faithful brother named James Watson, who dwelt in Invergowrie, two miles distant from the
      said town. That night, according to information given to us by William Spadin and John Watson, both men of good credit,
      he passed forth into a yard, a little before day. The said William and John followed privily, and took heed what he
      did. When he had gone up and down in an alley for some time, with many sobs and deep groans, he platt upon his knees,
      and remaining thus, his groans increased. From his knees, he fell upon his face; and then the persons forenamed heard
      weeping, and an indistinct sound, as it were of prayers. In this agony he continued for nearly an hour, and afterwards
      began to be quiet, when he arose and came in to his bed.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p116" shownumber="no">They that had watched got in before Master George, as if they had been ignorant of his absence until he came in; and then
      they began to ask where he had been. But that night he would answer nothing. Upon the morrow they urged him again;
      and, when he dissimulated, they said, "Master George, be plain with us; we heard your groans; yea, we heard your bitter
      mourning, and saw you both upon your knees and upon your face." With dejected visage, he said, "I had rather ye had
      been in your beds. It would have been more profitable<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_58">58</span> for you, for I was
      scarcely well employed." They insistently urged him to let them know something for their comfort, and he then said,
      "I will tell you that I am assured that my travail is near an end. Therefore call to God with me, that now I shrink
      not, when the battle waxes most hot." When they wept, and said, that was "small comfort unto them;" he answered, "God
      shall send you comfort after me. This realm shall be illuminated with the light of Christ's Evangel, as clearly as
      ever was any realm since the days of the Apostles. The house of God shall be builded in it. Yea, it shall not lack
      the very copestone, whatsoever the enemy imagine to the contrary." Neither shall this be long; there shall not many
      suffer after me, before the glory of God shall evidently appear, and shall once triumph in despite of Satan. But, alas!
      if the people shall thereafter be unthankful, fearful and terrible shall the plagues be that shall follow." With these
      words he marched forward in his journey towards Perth; and so to Fife, and then to Leith.

<p id="iii.i-p117" shownumber="no">Arrived in Leith, and hearing no word of those that had appointed to meet him, to wit, the Earl of Cassillis and the gentlemen
      of Kyle and Cunningham, Master George kept himself secret for a day or two. But beginning to wax sorrowful in spirit,
      and being asked the cause, he said, "What differ I from a dead man, except that I eat and drink? Unto this time, God
      has used my labours for the instruction of others, and for the disclosing of darkness; and now I lurk as a man that
      is ashamed, and dare not show himself before men." From these and like words, they that heard him understood that his
      desire was to preach; and therefore said they, "Most comfortable it were unto us to hear you; but, because we know
      the danger wherein ye stand, we dare not desire you." "Only dare ye and others hear," said he, "and then let my God
      provide for me, as best pleaseth Him." Finally, it was concluded that he should preach in Leith on the next Sunday.
      This he did, taking the text, "The parable of the sower that went forth to sow seed." (<a class="scripRef" id="iii.i-p117.1"

      Master George should remain in Leith, as the Governor and Cardinal were shortly to come to Edinburgh. Therefore they
      took him with them, and kept him sometimes in Brunstone, sometimes in Longniddry, and sometimes in Ormiston; for those
      three Lairds diligently waited upon him. On the Sunday following, he preached in the kirk of Inveresk, beside Musselburgh,
      both before and after noon. There was a great congregation of people, amongst them being Sir George Douglas, who said
      publicly after the sermon, "I know that my Lord Governor and my Lord Cardinal shall hear that I have been at this preaching.
      Say unto them that I will avow it, and will not only maintain the doctrine that I have heard, but also the person of

      nigh them, "I heartily pray you to make room for those two men. It may be that they be come to learn." Unto them he
      said, "Come near,"—they stood in the very entry of the door,—"for I assure you ye shall hear the Word of truth, which
      shall this same day seal unto you your salvation, or your condemnation." He then proceeded with his sermon, supposing
      that they would have been quiet. But, when he perceived that they still troubled the people that stood nigh them (for
      vehement was he against the false worshipping of God), he turned unto them the second time, and with an awful countenance
      said, "O sergeants of Satan and deceivers of the souls of men, will ye neither hear God's truth, nor suffer others
      to hear it? Depart, and take this for your portion,—God shall shortly confound and disclose your hypocrisy. Within
      this realm ye shall be abominable unto men, and your places and habitations shall be desolate." This sentence he pronounced
      with great vehemence, in the midst of the sermon;<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_60">60</span> and, turning to the
      people, he said, "Yon wicked men have provoked the Spirit of God to anger." Then he returned to his matter, and proceeded
      to the end.

      time that he had to travail, and of his death, the day whereof, he said, approached nigher than any would believe.

<p id="iii.i-p122" shownumber="no">Towards the close of those days that are called the holy days of Yule, he passed, by the consent of the gentlemen, to Haddington,
      where it was supposed the greatest confluence of people might be found, both by reason of the town and of the country
      adjacent. On the first day, before noon, the audience was reasonable, and yet nothing in comparison with that which
      used to be in that kirk. But, in the afternoon and on the next forenoon, the audience was so slender that many wondered.
      The reason was thought to have been that the Earl Bothwell, who in these bounds had great credit and obedience, had,
      by procurement of the Cardinal, given inhibition to the town, as well as to the country, that they should not hear
      Master George, under the pain of his displeasure. On the first night he lay within the town with David Forrest, now
      called the general, a man that long has professed the truth, and upon whom many in that time depended. On the second
      night he lay in Lethington, the Laird whereof was ever civil, albeit not persuaded in religion.

      that the gentlemen of the west had written to him that they could not keep diet at Edinburgh. The said John Knox, wondering
      that he desired to keep any<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_61">61</span> purpose before sermon, for that was never
      his custom, said, "Sir, the time of sermon approaches: I will leave you for the present to your meditation;" and so
      left him. The said Master George paced up and down behind the high altar for more than half an hour; his very countenance

      continued for nearly an hour and a half in such vehemency and threatening, and during this he foretold all the plagues
      that ensued, as plainly as afterwards our eyes saw them performed. In the end he said, "I have forgotten myself and
      the matter that I should have entreated; but let these my last words as concerning public preaching remain in your
      minds, until God send you new comfort." Thereafter he made a short paraphrase upon the second table, with an exhortation
      to patience, to the fear of God, and unto His works of mercy; and so ended, as it were making his last testament that

<p id="iii.i-p136" shownumber="no">His sermon was divided into four principal parts. The first was a short and brief declaration concerning the evangelist.
      The second was of the interpretation of the good seed; and because he called the Word of God the good seed, and heresy
      the evil seed, he declared what heresy was and how it should be known. He defined in this manner: "Heresy is a false
      opinion, defended with pertinacity, clearly repugning to the Word of God." The third part of his sermon was concerning
      the cause of heresy within that realm and all other realms. "The cause of heresy," quoth he, "is the ignorance of those
      who have the cure of men's souls. To them it necessarily belongeth to have the true understanding of the Word of God,
      that they may be able to win again the false doctors of heresies, with the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of
      God; and not only to win again, but also to overcome, as saith Paul, 'a bishop must be faultless, as becometh the minister
      of God, not stubborn, nor angry; no drunkard, no fighter, not given to filthy lucre; but harberous,<sup class="Note"

      doctrine, that he may be able to exhort with wholesome learning, and to improve that which they say against him.'"
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p137" shownumber="no">The fourth part of his sermon was as to how heresies should be known. "Heresies be known on this manner. As the goldsmith
      knoweth the fine gold from the imperfect, by use of the touchstone, so likewise may we know heresy by the undoubted
      touchstone, that is, the true, sincere, and undefiled Word of God." At the last, he added that "heretics should be
      put down in this present life. The Gospel appeared to repugn this proposition—'let them both grow unto the harvest.'
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_67">67</span> The harvest is the end of the world: nevertheless, he affirmed, they

      of devilish spite and malice, saying to the innocent Master George so many cruel and abominable words, and hitting
      him so spitefully with the Pope's thunder, that the ignorant people dreaded lest the earth then would have swallowed
      him up quick. Notwithstanding, he stood still with great patience hearing these sayings, not once moving or changing
      his countenance. When this fed sow had read throughout all his lying menaces, his face running down with sweat and
      he frothing at the mouth like a bear, he spat at Mr. George's face, saying "What answerest thou, thou runagate, traitor,
      and thief, to these sayings, which we have duly proved by sufficient witness against thee?" Master George, hearing
      this, sat down upon his knees in the pulpit, making his prayer to God. When he had ended his prayer, sweetly and Christianly
      he answered to them all in this manner.

      life. It is just, therefore, and reasonable, that you should know what my words and doctrine are, and what I have ever

      dread, so that your discretions give me your ears benevolent and attent."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p141" shownumber="no">Suddenly then, with a high voice, cried the accuser, the fed sow, "Thou heretic, runagate, traitor, and thief, it was not
      lawful for thee to preach. Thou hast taken the power at thine own hand, without any authority of the Church. We forethink
      <sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p141.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p141.1">85</a></sup><span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.i-p141.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.i-p141.1">85</a></sup>Repent.</span>      that thou hast been a preacher so long." Then said the whole congregation of the prelates, with their accomplices,
      "If we give him licence to preach, he is so crafty and in Holy Scripture so exercised that he will persuade the people
      to his opinion, and raise them against us."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p142" shownumber="no">Master George, seeing their malicious and wicked intent, appealed from the Lord Cardinal to the Lord Governor, as to an indifferent
      and equal judge. The accuser, John Lauder, with hoggish voice answered, "Is not my Lord Cardinal the second person
      within this realm, Chancellor of Scotland, Archbishop of St. Andrews, Bishop of Mirepoix, Commendator of Arbroath,
      <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legatus Natus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legatus a Latere</i>?" And so reciting as
      many titles of his unworthy honours as would have laden a ship, much sooner an ass,—"Is not he," quoth John Lauder,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_69">69</span> "an equal judge apparently to thee? Whom else desirest thou to be thy
      judge?"
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p143" shownumber="no">This humble man answered, "I refuse not my Lord Cardinal, but I desire the Word of God to be my judge, and the Temporal Estate,
      with some of your Lordships, my auditors; because I am here my Lord Governor's prisoner." Whereupon the prideful and
      scornful people that stood by, mocked him, saying, "Such man, such judge!" speaking seditious and reproachful words
      against the Governor and other the nobles, meaning them also to be heretics. Incontinent, without delay, they would
      have given sentence upon Master George, and that without further process, had not certain men there counselled my Lord
      Cardinal to read again the articles, and to hear his answers thereupon, that the people might not complain of his wrongful
      condemnation.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p144" shownumber="no">Shortly declared, the following were the articles, with his answers, as far as they would give him leave to speak; for when
      he intended to mitigate their lesings<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p144.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p144.1">86</a></sup>
      <span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.i-p144.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.i-p144.1">86</a></sup>Lying.</span>      and show the manner of his doctrines, by and by they stopped his mouth with another article.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p145" shownumber="no">1. Thou, false heretic, runagate, traitor, and thief, deceiver of the people, despisest the holy Church, and in like case
      contemnest my Lord Governor's authority. And we know for surety that, when thou preachedst in Dundee, and wast charged
      by my Lord Governor's authority to desist, thou wouldest not obey, but persevered in the same. And therefore the Bishop
      of Brechin cursed thee, and delivered thee into the Devil's hand, and gave thee commandment that thou shouldest preach
      no more. Yet, notwithstanding, thou didst continue obstinately.—My Lords, I have read in the Acts of the Apostles,
      that it is not lawful, for the threats and menacings of men, to desist from the preaching of the Evangel. It is written,
      "We shall rather obey God than men." I have also read in the Prophet Malachi, "I shall curse your blessings, and bless
      your cursings, says the Lord:" believing firmly that He would turn your cursings into blessings.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p146" shownumber="no">2. Thou, false heretic, didst say that a priest standing at<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_70">70</span> the altar saying
      Mass was like a fox wagging his tail in July.—My Lords, I said not so. These were my sayings. The moving of the body
      outward, without the inward moving of the heart, is nought else but the playing of an ape, and not the true serving
      of God; for God is a secret searcher of men's hearts. Therefore, who will truly adorn and honour God, he must in spirit
      and verity honour Him.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p147" shownumber="no">Then the accuser stopped his mouth with another article.</p>
<p id="iii.i-p148" shownumber="no">3. Thou, false heretic, preachest against the Sacraments, saying that there are not seven Sacraments.—My Lords, if it be
      your pleasure, I taught never of the number of the Sacraments, whether they were seven or eleven. So many as are instituted
      by Christ, and are shown to us by the Evangel, I profess openly. Except it be the Word of God, I dare affirm nothing.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p149" shownumber="no">4. Thou, false heretic, hast openly taught that auricular confession is not a blessed sacrament; and thou sayest that we
      should only confess to God, and to no priest.—My Lords, I say that auricular confession, seeing that it hath no promise
      of the Evangel, cannot be a sacrament. Of the confession to be made to God, there are many testimonies in Scripture;
      as when David saith, "I thought I would acknowledge my iniquity against myself unto the Lord; and He forgave the trespasses
      of my sins." Here, confession signifieth the secret knowledge of our sins before God. When I exhorted the people on
      this manner, I reproved no manner of confession. And further, St. James saith, "Acknowledge your sins one to another,
      and so let you to have peace amongst yourselves." Here the Apostle meaneth nothing of auricular confession, but that
      we should acknowledge and confess ourselves to be sinners before our brethren and before the world, and not esteem
      ourselves as the Grey Friars do, thinking themselves already purged.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p150" shownumber="no">When he had said these words, the horned bishops and their accomplices cried, and girned<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p150.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p150.1">87</a></sup>
      <span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.i-p150.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.i-p150.1">87</a></sup>Gnashed.</span>      with their teeth, saying, "See ye not what colours he hath in his speech, that he may beguile us, and seduce us to
      his opinion."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p151" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_71">71</span></p>
<p id="iii.i-p152" shownumber="no">5. Thou, heretic, didst say openly, that it was necessary to every man to know and understand his baptism, and that it was
      contrary to general councils, and the estates of Holy Church.—My Lords, I believe there be none so unwise here that
      will make merchandise with a Frenchman, or any other unknown stranger, except he know and understand first the condition
      or promise made by the Frenchman or stranger. So, likewise, I would that we understood what things we promise in the
      name of the infant unto God in baptism. For this cause, I believe ye have confirmation.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p153" shownumber="no">Then said Master Bleiter, chaplain, that he had the devil within him, and the spirit of error. A child answered him, "The
      Devil cannot speak such words as yonder man doth speak."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p154" shownumber="no">6. Thou, false heretic, traitor, and thief, saidst that the Sacrament of the altar was but a piece of bread, baken upon the
      ashes, and nothing else; and all that is there done is but a superstitious rite against the commandment of God....—O
      Lord God! So manifest lies and blasphemies the Scripture doth not teach you. As concerning the Sacrament of the altar,
      my Lords, I never taught anything against the Scripture, which I shall, by God's grace, make manifest this day, I being
      ready therefor to suffer death.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p155" shownumber="no">The lawful use of the Sacrament is most acceptable unto God: the great abuse of it is very detestable unto Him. But what
      occasion they have to say such words of me, I shall shortly show your Lordships. I once chanced to meet with a Jew,
      when I was sailing upon the water of Rhine. I did inquire of him what was the cause of his pertinacity in not believing
      that the true Messias was come, considering that they had seen fulfilled all the prophecies which were spoken of Him;
      moreover, the prophecies taken away, and the sceptre of Judah. By many other testimonies of the Scripture, I vanquished
      him, and proved that Messias was come, whom they called Jesus of Nazareth. This Jew answered me, "When Messias cometh,
      he shall restore all things, and he shall not abrogate the Law, which was given to our fathers, as ye do. For why?
      we see the poor almost perish through<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_72">72</span> hunger among you, yet you are not
      moved with pity towards them; but among us Jews, though we be poor, there are no beggars found. Secondly, it is forbidden
      by the Law to feign any kind of imagery of things in heaven above or in the earth beneath or in the sea under the earth,
      but one God only to honour: your sanctuaries and churches are full of idols. Thirdly, ye adore and worship a piece
      of bread baken upon the ashes, and say that it is your God." I have rehearsed here but the sayings of the Jew, which
      I never affirmed to be true.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p156" shownumber="no">Then the bishops shook their heads, and spat on the ground. What he meant to say further in this matter, they would not hear.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p157" shownumber="no">7. Thou, false heretic, didst say that extreme unction was not a sacrament.—My Lords, forsooth, I never taught anything of
      extreme unction in my doctrine, whether it was a sacrament or no.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p158" shownumber="no">8. Thou, false heretic, saidst that the holy water is not so good as wash, and such like. Thou contemnest conjuring, and
      sayest that Holy Church's cursing availeth not.—My Lords, as for holy water, of what strength it is, I never taught
      in my doctrine. Conjurings and exorcisms, if they were conformable to the Word of God, I would commend. But in so far
      as they are not conformable to the commandment and Word of God, I reprove them.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p159" shownumber="no">9. Thou, false heretic and runagate, hast said that every layman is a priest; and thou sayest that the Pope hath no more
      power than any other man.—My Lords, I taught nothing but the Word of God. I remember that I have read in some places
      in St. John and St. Peter, of whom one sayeth, "He hath made us kings and priests;" the other sayeth, "He hath made
      us the kingly priesthood." Wherefore, I have affirmed that any man, being cunning and perfect in the Word of God and
      the true faith of Jesus Christ, has his power given him from God, and that not by the power or violence of men, but
      by the virtue of the Word of God—the Word which is called the power of God, as St. Paul witnesseth evidently enough.
      And again I say that any unlearned man, not exercised in the Word of God, nor yet constant in his faith, of whatsoever
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_73">73</span> estate or order he be, hath no power to bind or loose, seeing he lacketh
      the instrument by the which he bindeth or looseth, that is to say, the Word of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p160" shownumber="no">After he had said these words all the bishops laughed, and mocked him. When he beheld their laughing, "Laugh ye," saith he,
      "my Lords? Though these my sayings appear scornful and worthy of derision to your Lordships, they are nevertheless
      very weighty to me, and of a great value; because they stand not only upon my life, but also the honour and glory of
      God."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p161" shownumber="no">In the meantime many godly men, beholding the wodness<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p161.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p161.1">88</a></sup>
      <span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.i-p161.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.i-p161.1">88</a></sup>Fury.</span>      and great cruelty of the bishops, and the invincible patience of the said Master George, did greatly mourn and lament.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p162" shownumber="no">10. Thou, false heretic, saidst that a man hath no free will, but is like to the Stoics, who say that it is not in man's
      will to do anything, but that concupiscence and desire cometh of God, of whatsoever kind it be.—My Lords, I said not
      so, truly: I say that unto as many as believe in Christ firmly is given liberty, conformable to the saying of St. John,
      "If the Son make you free, then shall ye verily be free." Of the contrary, as many as believe not in Christ Jesus,
      they are bound servants of sin: "He that sinneth is bound to sin."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p163" shownumber="no">11. Thou, false heretic, sayest it is as lawful to eat flesh upon Friday, as on Sunday.—May it please your Lordships, I have
      read in the Epistles of St. Paul that "to the clean, all things are clean." Of the contrary, "To filthy men, all things
      are unclean." A faithful man, clean and holy, sanctifieth by the Word the creature of God; but the creature maketh
      no man acceptable unto God: so that a creature may not sanctify any impure and unfaithful man. But to the faithful
      man, all things are sanctified by the prayer of the Word of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p164" shownumber="no">After these sayings of Master George, all the bishops, with their accomplices, said, "What witness need we against him: hath
      he not openly here spoken blasphemy?"
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p165" shownumber="no">12. Thou, false heretic, dost say that we should not pray to saints, but to God only. Say whether thou hast said this or
      no: say shortly.—For the weakness and the infirmity of the<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_74">74</span> hearers, without
      doubt, plainly, saints should not be honoured or called upon. My Lords, there are two things worthy of note: the one
      is certain and the other uncertain. It is found plainly and certain in Scriptures that we should worship and honour
      one God, according to the saying of the first commandment, "Thou shall only worship and honour thy Lord God with all
      thy heart." But as to praying to and honouring of saints, there is great doubt among many, whether or no they hear
      invocation made unto them. Therefore, I exhorted all men equally in my doctrine that they should leave the unsure way,
      and follow the way which was taught us by our Master Christ: He only is our Mediator, and maketh intercession for us
      to God, His Father: He is the door, by which we must enter in: He that entereth not in by this door, but climbeth another
      way, is a thief and a murderer: He is the truth and life. There is no doubt but he that goeth out of this way shall
      fall into the mire; yea, verily, he is fallen into it already. This is the fashion of my doctrine, which I have ever
      followed. Verily, that which I have heard and read in the Word of God I taught openly and in no corners, and now ye
      shall witness the same, if your Lordships will hear me. I dare not be so bold as affirm anything unless it agree with
      the Word of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p166" shownumber="no">These sayings he rehearsed divers times.</p>
<p id="iii.i-p167" shownumber="no">13. Thou, false heretic, hast preached plainly that there is no purgatory, and that it is a feigned thing that any man, after
      this life, will be punished in purgatory.—My Lords, as I have oftentimes said heretofore, without express witness and
      testimony of Scripture, I dare affirm nothing. I have oft and divers times read over the Bible, and yet such a term
      found I never, nor yet any place of Scripture applicable thereto. Therefore, I was ashamed ever to teach of that which
      I could not find in Scripture.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p168" shownumber="no">Then said he to Master John Lauder, his accuser, "If you have any testimony of the Scripture, by the which ye may prove any
      such place, show it now before this audience." But that dolt had not a word to say for himself, but was as dumb as
      a beetle in that matter.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p169" shownumber="no">14. Thou, false heretic, hast taught plainly against the<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_75">75</span> vows of monks, friars,
      nuns, and priests, saying that whosoever was bound by such vows did vow themselves to the state of damnation. Moreover,
      thou hast taught that it was lawful for priests to marry wives, and not to live sole.—Of sooth, my Lords, I have read
      in the Evangel that there are three kinds of chaste men: some are gelded from their mother's womb; some are gelded
      by men; and some have gelded themselves for the kingdom of heaven's sake: verily, I say, these men are blessed by the
      Scripture of God. But as many as have not the gift of chastity, nor yet for the Evangel have overcome the concupiscence
      of the flesh, and have vowed chastity, ye have experience, although I should hold my tongue, to what inconvenience
      they have vowed themselves.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p170" shownumber="no">When he had said these words, they were all dumb, thinking it better to have ten concubines, than one married wife.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p171" shownumber="no">15. Thou, false heretic and runagate, sayest that thou wilt not obey our General or Provincial Councils.—My Lords, I know
      not what your General Councils are. I never studied that matter; but gave my labours to the pure Word of God. Read
      here your General Councils, or else give me a book wherein they are contained, that I may read of them. If they agree
      with the Word of God, I will not disagree.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p172" shownumber="no">Then the ravening wolves became mad, and said, "Whereunto do we let him speak any further? Read forth the rest of the articles,
      and stay not upon them." Amongst these cruel tigers there was one false hypocrite, a seducer of the people, called
      John Scott, who, standing behind John Lauder's back, hasted him to read the rest of the articles, and not to tarry
      for Master George's witty and godly answers; "For we may not abide them," quoth he, "no more than the Devil may abide
      the sign of the Cross when it is named."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p173" shownumber="no">16. Thou, heretic, sayest, that it is vain to build to the honour of God costly churches, seeing that God remaineth not in
      churches made by men's hands, nor yet can God be in so little space, as betwixt the priest's hands.—My Lords, Solomon
      saith, "If the heaven of heavens cannot comprehend Thee, how much less this house that I have builded." And Job consenteth
      to the same sentence, saying, "Seeing that He<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_76">76</span> is higher than the heavens,
      what canst thou build unto Him? He is deeper than the hell, then how shalt thou know Him? He is longer than the earth,
      and broader than the sea." God cannot be comprehended into one space, because He is infinite. These sayings notwithstanding,
      I never said that churches should be destroyed; but, on the contrary, I ever affirmed that churches should be sustained
      and upholden, and that the people should be congregated in them to hear the Word of God preached. Moreover, wheresoever
      there is the true preaching of the Word of God and the lawful use of the Sacraments, undoubtedly God is there Himself.
      Thus, both these sayings are true together. God cannot be comprehended into any one place: and, "Wheresoever there
      are two or three gathered in His name, there is He present in the midst of them."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p174" shownumber="no">Then said he to his accuser, "If thou thinkest any otherwise, then I say, show further thy reasons before this audience."
      He, without all reason, was dumb, and could not answer a word.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p175" shownumber="no">17. Thou, false heretic, contemnest fasting, and sayest thou shouldest not fast.—My Lords, I find that fasting is commanded
      in the Scripture; therefore I were a slanderer of the Gospel if I contemned fasting. Not only so, I have learned by
      experience that fasting is good for the health and conservation of the body. But God knoweth only who fasteth the true
      fast.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p176" shownumber="no">18. Thou, false heretic, hast preached openly, saying, that the souls of men shall sleep to the latter day of judgment, and
      shall not obtain life immortal until that day.—God, full of mercy and goodness, forgive him that sayeth such things
      of me. I wot and know surely, by the Word of God, that the soul of him that hath begun to have the faith of Jesus Christ
      and believeth firmly in Him, shall never sleep, but ever shall live an immortal life. That life is renewed in grace
      from day to day and augmented; nor shall it ever perish or have an end, but shall ever live immortal with Christ its
      Head. To this life, all that believe in Him shall come, and then shall remain in eternal glory. Amen.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p177" shownumber="no">When the bishops, with their accomplices, had accused<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_77">77</span> this innocent man, in
      manner and form aforesaid, they incontinently condemned him to be burned as a heretic, not having respect to his godly
      answers and the true reasons which he alleged, nor yet to their own consciences. They thought, verily, that they should
      do to God good sacrifice, conformably to the sayings of Jesus Christ in the Gospel of St. John, chapter sixteen: "They
      shall excommunicate you; yea, and the time shall come that he which killeth you shall think that he hath done to God
      good service."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p178" shownumber="no">The following is the prayer of Master George. "O immortal God! how long shalt Thou suffer the wodness and great credulity
      of the ungodly to exercise their fury upon Thy servants, who do further Thy Word in this world. They desire to do the
      contrary, to choke and destroy the true doctrine and truth, whereby Thou hast showed Thee unto the world, which was
      all drowned in blindness and misknowledge of Thy name. O Lord, we know surely that Thy true servants must needs suffer,
      for Thy name's sake, persecution, affliction, and troubles in this present life, which is but a shadow, as Thou hast
      showed to us by Thy prophets and apostles. But yet we desire Thee, merciful Father, that Thou wouldest preserve, defend,
      and help Thy congregation, which Thou hast chosen before the beginning of the world, and give them Thy grace to hear
      Thy word, and to be true servants in this present life."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p179" shownumber="no">Then, by and by, the common people were removed (for their desire was always to hear that innocent speak) and the sons of
      darkness pronounced their sentence definitive, not having respect to the judgment of God. When all this was done and
      said, my Lord Cardinal caused his tormentors to pass again with the meek lamb unto the Castle, until such time as the
      fire was made ready. When he was come into the Castle, there came two Grey fiends, Friar Scott and his mate, saying,
      "Sir, ye must make your confession unto us." He answered and said, "I will make no confession unto you. Go fetch me
      yonder man that preached this day, and I will make my confession unto him." Then they sent for the Sub-prior of the
      Abbey, who came to him with all diligence; but what he said in this confession I cannot show.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p180" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_78">78</span></p>
<p id="iii.i-p181" shownumber="no">When the fire and the gallows were made ready at the west part of the Castle, near to the Priory, my Lord Cardinal, dreading
      that Master George should have been taken away by his friends, commanded his men to bend all the ordnance of the Castle
      against the place of execution, and commanded all his gunners to be ready, and stand beside their guns, until such
      time as he was burned. All this being done, they bound Master George's hands behind his back, and led him forth from
      the Castle with their soldiers, to the place of their cruel and wicked execution. As he came forth from the Castle
      gate, there met him certain beggars asking his alms, for God's sake. To these he answered, "I want my hands, wherewith
      I was wont to give you alms. But may the merciful Lord, who feedeth all men, vouchsafe of His benignity and abundant
      grace to give you necessaries, both for your bodies and souls." Then met him two false fiends—I should say, Friars—saying,
      "Master George, pray to our Lady that she may be a mediatrix for you to her Son." To them he answered meekly, "Cease:
      tempt me not, my brethren." After this he was led to the fire, with a rope about his neck, and a chain of iron about
      his middle.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p181.1">Master George Wishart is brought to the Stake.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p182" shownumber="no">When he came to the fire he sat down upon his knees, and rose again; and thrice he said these words, "O Thou Saviour of the
      world, have mercy upon me: Father of heaven, I commend my spirit into Thy holy hands." When he had made this prayer,
      he turned him to the people, and said these words: "I beseech you, Christian brethren and sisters, that ye be not offended
      at the Word of God because of the affliction and torments which ye see already prepared for me. I exhort you that ye
      love the Word of God, your salvation, and suffer patiently and with a comfortable heart, for the Word's sake, which
      is your undoubted salvation and everlasting comfort. Moreover, I pray you, urge upon those of my brethren and sisters
      who have heard me oft before that they cease not nor leave off to learn that Word of God which I taught them, according

      that my doctrine was no wives'<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_79">79</span> fables, after the constitution made by
      men; if I had taught men's doctrine, I should have gotten greater thanks from men. But, for the Word's sake, and for
      the true Evangel, given to me by the grace of God, I suffer this day by men, not sorrowfully, but with a glad heart
      and mind. For this cause I was sent, that I should suffer this fire for Christ's sake. Consider and behold my visage;
      ye shall not see me change my colour. This grim fire I fear not; and so I pray you to do, if any persecution come unto
      you for the Word's sake. Do not fear them that slay the body, and afterwards have no power to slay the soul. Some have
      said of me that I taught that the soul of man should sleep until the last day; but I know surely that this night, before
      six o'clock, my soul shall sup with my Saviour, for whom I suffer this."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p183" shownumber="no">Then Master George prayed for them that accused him, saying, "I beseech Thee, Father of Heaven, to forgive them that have
      of any ignorance, or else of any evil mind, forged lies upon me; I forgive them with all mine heart: I beseech Christ
      to forgive them that have condemned me to death this day, ignorantly." And last of all, he said to the people on this
      manner, "I beseech you, brethren and sisters, to exhort your prelates to the learning of the Word of God, that they
      at least may be ashamed to do evil and learn to do good; and if they will not convert themselves from their wicked
      error, there shall hastily come upon them the wrath of God, and that they shall not eschew."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p184" shownumber="no">Many faithful words said he in the meantime, taking no heed or care of the cruel torments which were then prepared for him.
      Then, last of all, the hangman that was his tormentor, sat down upon his knees, and said, "Sir, I pray you, forgive
      me, for I am not guilty of your death." To whom he answered, "Come hither to me." When he was come to him, he kissed
      his cheek, and said, "Lo! here is a token that I forgive thee. My heart, do thine office." And then by and by he was
      put upon the gibbet, and hanged, and there burned to powder. When the people beheld the great tormenting of that innocent,
      they could not refrain from piteous mourning and complaining of the innocent lamb's slaughter.

<p id="iii.i-p186" shownumber="no">After the death of this blessed martyr of God, the people began, in plain speaking, to damn and detest the cruelty that was
      used. Yea, men of great birth, estimation, and honour, avowed at open tables that the blood of the said Master George
      should be revenged, or else it should cost life for life. Amongst these John Leslie, brother to the Earl of Rothes,
      was the chief; for he spared not to say in all companies, "This same whinger," drawing his dagger, "and this same hand,
      shall be priests to the Cardinal." These bruits came to the Cardinal's ears; but he thought himself stout enough for
      all Scotland; for in Babylon, that is, in his new block-house, he was secure, as he thought; and upon the field he
      was able to match all his enemies. To write the truth, the most part of the nobility of Scotland had either given unto
      him their bonds of manrent, or else were in confederacy, and promised amity with him....

It was bruited that something was purposed against
      him at that time by the Earl of Angus and his friends, whom he mortally hated, and whose destruction he sought. But
      it failed, and so returned he to his strength; yea, to his god and only comfort, as well in heaven as in earth. And
      there he remained without the least fear of death, promising unto himself no less pleasure than did the rich man of
      whom mention is made by our Master in the Evangel. He did not only rejoice and say, "Eat and be glad, my soul, for
      thou hast great riches laid up in store for many days;" but also, "Tush, a fig for the feud, and a button for the bragging
      of all the heretics and their assistants in Scotland. Is not my Lord Governor mine? Witness his eldest son there in
      pledge at my table? Have I not the Queen at my own devotion? (He alluded to the mother of Mary that now mischievously
      reigns.) Is not France my friend, and am not I friend to France? What danger should I fear?" Thus, in vanity, the carnal
      Cardinal delighted himself a little before his death....
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p188" shownumber="no">Early upon Saturday morning, the twenty-ninth of May<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_81">81</span> 1546, there were sundry
      companies in the Abbey kirk-yard, in St. Andrews, not far distant from the Castle. The gates of the Castle being opened,
      and the draw-bridge let down for admission of lime and stones and other things necessary for building, for Babylon
      was almost finished, William Kirkaldy of Grange, younger, and with him six persons, got entrance, and held purpose
      with the porter, inquiring "If my Lord was walking?" He answered, "No." While the said William and the porter talked,
      and his servants pretended to look at the work and the workmen, Norman Leslie approached with his company; and, because
      they were in no great number, they easily got entrance. They directed their course to the very middle of the close,
      and immediately thereafter came John Leslie, somewhat rudely, and four persons with him. The porter, taking fright,
      would have drawn the bridge; but the said John, being entered thereon, stayed and leapt in. When the porter made for
      his defence, his head was broken, the keys were taken from him, and he cast into the fosse; and so the place was seized.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p189" shownumber="no">Shouts arose; the workmen, to the number of more than a hundred, ran off the walls, and were without hurt put forth at the
      wicket gate. The first thing, William Kirkaldy took the guard of the privy postern, fearing that the fox should escape.
      Then went the rest to the gentlemen's chambers, and without violence done to any man, put more than fifty persons to
      the gate. The number that enterprised and did this was but sixteen persons. The Cardinal, awakened with the shouts,
      asked from his window what that noise meant. It was answered that Norman Leslie had taken his Castle. This understood,
      he ran for his postern; but, perceiving the passage to be guarded, he returned quickly to his chamber, took his two-handed
      sword, and gart<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p189.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p189.1">90</a></sup><span class="mnote"

</p>
<p id="iii.i-p190" shownumber="no">In the meantime came John Leslie and bade the door be opened. The Cardinal asking, "Who calls?" he answered, "My name is
      Leslie." He again asked, "Is that Norman?" The other said, "Nay; my name is John." "I will have<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_82">82</span>      Norman," said the Cardinal; "for he is my friend." "Content yourself with such as are here; ye shall get none other."
      With the said John were James Melvin, a man familiarly acquainted with Master George Wishart, and Peter Carmichael,

      they forced at the door, the Cardinal hid a box of gold under coals that were laid in a secret corner. At length he
      asked, "Will ye save my life?" The said John answered, "It may be that we will." "Nay," said the Cardinal, "Swear unto
      me by God's wounds, and I will open unto you." Then answered the said John, "It that was said, is unsaid;" and cried,
      "Fire, Fire," for the door was very stark.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p190.2"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p190.2">92</a></sup>

<p id="iii.i-p191" shownumber="no">John Leslie, according to his former vows, struck the Cardinal once or twice, and so did the said Peter. But James Melvin,
      a man of nature most gentle and most modest, perceiving that they were both in choler, withdrew them, and said, "This
      work and judgment of God, although it be secret, ought to be done with greater gravity." Presenting the point of his
      sword at the Cardinal, he said, "Repent thee of thy former wicked life, but especially of the shedding of the blood
      of that notable instrument of God, Master George Wishart, which, albeit the flame of fire consumed it before men, yet

      hatred of thy person, nor the love of thy riches, nor the fear of any trouble thou couldst have brought on me in particular,
      doth move me to strike thee, I do so only because thou hast been and remainest an obstinate enemy against Christ Jesus

      caused to be summoned, then denounced, accursed, and last, proclaimed rebels, not only the first enterprisers, but
      all such as did accompany them. And last of all, the siege of the Castle was decided upon.

<p id="iii.i-p193" shownumber="no">The siege began in the end of August; for on the twenty-third day thereof the soldiers departed from Edinburgh, and it continued
      until near the end of January. At that time, they had no other hope of winning it but by hunger; and of that they were
      despaired, for those within had broken through the east wall, and made a plain passage by an iron gate to the sea.
      This greatly relieved the besieged, and abased the besiegers; for they could not stop them of victuals, unless they
      should be masters of the sea, and that they clearly understood they could not be.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p194" shownumber="no">The English ships had been there once already, and had brought William Kirkaldy from London, and had taken with them to the
      Court of England, John Leslie and Master Henry Balnaves, for the perfecting of all contracts. King Harry had promised
      to take them into his protection, upon condition that they should keep the Governor's son, my Lord of Arran, and stand
      friends to the contract of marriage before mentioned. These things clearly understood by the Governor and by his Council,
      the priests, and the shaven sort, they concluded to make an Appointment, to the end that they might either get the
      Castle betrayed, or else some principal men of the company taken unawares.

      That they of the Castle should keep the Earl of Arran, so long as their pledges were kept. There were other such articles,
      and all were liberal enough; for the Governor and his Council never intended to keep a word of them, as the issue did

<p id="iii.i-p196" shownumber="no">The Appointment was made, and all the godly were glad; for they had some hope that thereby God's Word should somewhat bud,
      as indeed it did. For John Rough, who had entered the Castle soon after the Cardinal's slaughter, and had continued
      with them during the siege, began to preach in St. Andrews. Albeit he was not the most learned, his doctrine was without
      corruption, and therefore well liked by the people.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p196.1">John Knox comes to the Castle of St. Andrews.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p197" shownumber="no">At the Easter following, John Knox came to the Castle of St. Andrews. Wearied of removing from place to place, by reason
      of the persecution that came upon him by this Archbishop of St. Andrews, he had determined to have left Scotland, and
      to have visited the schools of Germany. Of England he had no pleasure then. There, albeit the Pope's name had been
      suppressed, his laws and corruptions remained in full vigour. But the said John had the care of some gentlemen's children,
      whom for certain years he had nourished in godliness, and their fathers solicited him to go to St. Andrews, that he
      himself might have the protection of the Castle, and their children the benefit of his tuition. So came he thither
      at the time mentioned, and, having in his company Frances Douglas of Longniddry, George his brother, and Alexander
      Cockburn, then eldest son to the Laird of Ormiston, he began to exercise them after his accustomed manner.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p198" shownumber="no">Besides their grammar and other human authors, he read<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_85">85</span> to his pupils a catechism
      of which he caused them to give an account publicly, in the Parish Kirk of St. Andrews. Moreover, he read unto them
      the Evangel of John, and that lecture he delivered in the chapel within the Castle, at a certain hour. Those of the
      place, but especially Master Henry Balnaves and John Rough, preacher, perceiving the manner of his doctrine, began
      earnestly to travail with him that he would take the preaching place upon him. But he utterly refused, alleging that
      he would not run where God had not called him; meaning that he would do nothing without a lawful vocation.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p198.1">John Knox is called to the Office of Preacher.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p199" shownumber="no">Whereupon, advising privily among themselves, and having with them Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount, they decided to give a
      charge to the said John, and that publicly by the mouth of their preacher. And so, upon a certain day, a sermon was
      delivered concerning the election of ministers—what power the congregation (however small, passing the number of two
      or three) had over any man in whom they supposed and espied the gifts of God to be, and how dangerous it was to refuse,
      and not to hear the voice of such as desired to be instructed. Then the said John Rough, preacher, directed his words
      to the said John Knox, saying, "Brother, ye must not be offended if I speak unto you that which I have in charge from
      all those that are here present, namely this: In the name of God and of His Son Jesus Christ, and in the name of these
      that presently call you by my mouth, I charge you that ye refuse not this holy vocation, but that—as ye seek the glory
      of God, the increase of Christ's Kingdom, the edification of your brethren, and the comfort of me, whom ye well enough
      understand to be oppressed by the multitude of labours—ye take upon you the public office and charge of preaching,
      even as ye look to avoid God's heavy displeasure, and desire that He shall multiply His graces with you."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p200" shownumber="no">In the end, the preacher said to those that were present, "Was not this your charge to me? And do ye not approve this vocation?"
      They answered, "It was; and we approve it." Thereat the said John, abashed, burst forth in most abundant tears, and
      withdrew himself to his chamber. His<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_86">86</span> countenance and behaviour, from that
      day until the day that he was compelled to present himself in the public place of preaching, did sufficiently declare
      the grief and trouble of his heart. No man saw in him any sign of mirth, nor yet had he pleasure to accompany any man,
      for many days together.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p200.1">John Knox denounces the Roman Kirk: his Challenge.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p201" shownumber="no">Another necessity caused him to enter the public place, besides the vocation foresaid. Dean John Annan, a rotten Papist,
      had long troubled John Rough in his preaching: and the said John Knox had fortified the doctrine of the preacher by
      his pen, and had beaten the said Dean John from all defences, so that he was compelled to fly to his last refuge, that
      is, to the authority of the Church, "which authority," said he, "damned all Lutherans and heretics; and therefore he
      needed no further disputation." John Knox answered, "Before we hold ourselves convicted, or ye can sufficiently prove
      us so, we must define the Church, by the right notes of the true Church given to us in God's Scriptures. We must discern
      the immaculate spouse of Jesus Christ from the Mother of Confusion, spiritual Babylon, lest imprudently we embrace
      a harlot instead of the chaste spouse; yea, to speak it in plain words, lest we submit ourselves to Satan, thinking
      that we submit ourselves to Jesus Christ. For, as for your Roman Kirk, as it is now corrupted, and the authority thereof,
      wherein stands the hope of your victory, I no more doubt that it is the synagogue of Satan, and the head thereof, called
      the Pope, that man of sin of whom the Apostle speaks, than do I doubt that Jesus Christ suffered by the procurement
      of the visible Kirk of Jerusalem. Yea, I offer myself to prove, by word or writing, that the Roman Church is this day
      further degenerate from the purity which was in the days of the Apostles than was the Church of the Jews from the ordinance
      given by Moses, when it consented to the innocent death of Christ."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p202" shownumber="no">These words were spoken in open audience, in the parish Kirk of Saint Andrews, after the said Dean John Annan had spoken
      as it pleased him, and had refused to dispute. The people, hearing the offer, cried with one consent, "We cannot all
      read your writings, but we may all hear your preaching;<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_87">87</span> therefore we require
      you, in the name of God, that ye let us hear the probation of that which ye have affirmed; for if it be true, we have
      been miserably deceived." And so, the next Sunday was appointed to the said John to express his mind in the public
      preaching place.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p202.1">The first Public Sermon of John Knox is made in the Parish Kirk of St. Andrews.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p203" shownumber="no">The day approaching, the said John took the text written in Daniel, the seventh chapter, beginning thus: "And another King
      shall rise after them, and he shall be unlike unto the first, and he shall subdue three kings, and shall speak words
      against the Most High, and shall consume the saints of the Most High, and think that he may change times and laws.
      And they shall be given into his hands until a time, and times, and dividing of times."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p204" shownumber="no">1. In the beginning of his sermon, he shewed the great love of God towards His Church, whom it pleaseth Him to forewarn of
      dangers to come, many years before they come to pass. 2. He briefly treated of the state of the Israelites, who then
      were in bondage in Babylon for the most part; and made a short discourse concerning the four Empires, the Babylonian,
      the Persian, that of the Greeks, and that of the Romans; in the destruction whereof rose up that last Beast, which
      he affirmed to be the Roman Church,—for all the notes that God hath shewn to the prophet do appertain to none other
      power than has ever yet been, except to it alone, and unto it they do so properly appertain, that such as are not more
      than blind may clearly see them. 3. But before he began to open the corruptions of the Papistry, he defined the true
      Kirk, shewed the true notes of it, whereupon it was builded, why it was the pillar of truth, and why it could not err,
      to wit, "Because it heard the voice of its own pastor, Jesus Christ, would not hear a stranger, neither yet would be
      carried about with every kind of doctrine."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p205" shownumber="no">Every one of these heads sufficiently declared, he entered on the contrary proposition; and, upon the notes given in his
      text, he shewed that the Spirit of God in the New Testament gave to this king other names, to wit, "The Man of Sin,"
      "The Anti-Christ," "The Whore of Babylon." He shewed that this<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_88">88</span> man of
      sin, or Anti-Christ, was not to be restricted to the person of any one man only, no more than by the fourth beast was
      to be understood the person of any one Emperor. But by such means the Spirit of God sought to forewarn His chosen of
      a body and a multitude having a wicked head, who should not only be sinful himself, but should be occasion of sin to
      all that should be subject unto him,—as Christ Jesus, is cause of justice to all the members of His body. He is called
      the Anti-Christ, that is to say, one contrary to Christ, because he is contrary to Him in life, doctrine, laws, and
      subjects.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p206" shownumber="no">Then began he to decipher the lives of divers Popes, and the lives of all the shavelings for the most part; their doctrine
      and laws he plainly proved to be directly repugnant to the doctrine and laws of God the Father and of Christ Jesus,
      His Son. This he proved by comparing the doctrine of justification expressed in the Scriptures, which teach that man
      is "justified by faith only," and "that the blood of Jesus Christ purges us from all our sins;" and the doctrine of
      the Papists, which attributeth justification to the works of the law, yea, to such works of man's invention as pilgrimage,
      pardons, and other such baggage. That the papistical laws were repugnant to the laws of the Evangel, he proved by the
      laws made concerning observation of days, abstaining from meats, and from marriage which Christ Jesus made free, and
      the forbidding whereof Saint Paul called "the doctrine of devils."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p207" shownumber="no">In handling the notes of that Beast, given in the text, he willed men to consider if these notes, "There shall one arise
      unlike to the other, having a mouth speaking great things and blasphemous," could be applied to any other but the Pope
      and his Kingdom; for "if these," said he, "be not great words and blasphemous, 'the Successor of Peter,' 'the Vicar
      of Christ,' 'the Head of the Kirk,' 'Most Holy,' 'Most Blessed,' 'that cannot err;' that 'may make right of wrong,
      and wrong of right;' that 'of nothing, may make somewhat;' that 'hath all truth in the shrine of his breast;' yea,
      'that has power over all, and none power over him;' nay, 'not to say that he does wrong, although he draw ten thousand
      million of souls with<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_89">89</span> himself to hell:' if these," said he, "and many
      other, able to be shown in his own canon law, be not grave and blasphemous words, and such as never mortal man spake
      before, let the world judge.

      harlot, among other things, shall be the bodies and souls of men.' Now, let the very Papists themselves judge if ever
      any before them took upon them power to relax the pains of them that were in purgatory, as they affirm to the people
      that they do by the merits of their Mass and of their other trifles, daily." In the end, he said, "If any here"—and
      there were present Master John Major, the University, the Sub-prior, and many Canons, with some Friars of both the
      Orders—"will say that I have alleged Scripture, teaching, or history, otherwise than it is written, let them come unto
      me with sufficient witness, and by conference I shall let them see not only the original where my testimonies are written,
      but I shall prove that the writers meant what I have spoken."

      spoke never so plainly, and yet he was burned: even so will he be." In the end, others said, "The tyranny of the Cardinal
      made not his cause the better, nor yet did the suffering of God's servant make his cause the worse, and therefore we
      would counsel you and them to provide better defences than fire and sword, for it may be that else ye will be disappointed.
      Men now have other eyes than they had then." This answer gave the Laird of Nydie, a man fervent and upright in religion.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p210.1">John Knox is called on to defend his Doctrine.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p211" shownumber="no">The bastard Archbishop, who was not yet execrated (consecrated, they call it) wrote to the Sub-prior at Saint Andrews, who,
      <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sede vacante</i>, was Vicar-general, that he wondered that he suffered such heretical and
      schismatical doctrine to be taught, and did not oppose himself to the same. Upon this rebuke, there was appointed a
      Convention of Grey Friars and black fiends with the said Sub-prior, Dean John Winram, in Saint Leonard's yards. Thereunto
      was first called John Rough, and certain Articles were read unto him; and thereafter was John Knox called for. The
      cause of their Convention, and why they were called, was set forth, and the following Articles were read:—(1) No mortal
      man can be the head of the Church. (2) The Pope is an Anti-Christ, and so is no member of Christ's mystical body. (3)
      Man may neither make nor devise a religion that is acceptable to God: but man is bound to observe and keep the religion
      that from God is received, without chopping or changing thereof. (4) The Sacraments of the New Testament ought to be
      administered as they were instituted by Christ Jesus, and practised by His Apostles: nothing ought to be added unto
      them; nothing ought to be diminished from them. (5) The Mass is abominable idolatry, blasphemous to the death of Christ,
      and a profanation of the Lord's Supper. (6) There is no purgatory in which the souls of men are pained or purged after
      this life. Heaven remains for the faithful, and hell for the reprobate and unthankful. (7) Praying for the dead is
      vain, and prayer to the dead is idolatry. (8) There are no bishops unless they preach themselves, without any substitute.
      (9) By God's law the teinds do not appertain of necessity to the Kirk-men.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p212" shownumber="no">"The strangeness," said the Sub-prior, "of these Articles, which are gathered from your teaching, have moved us to call for
      you to hear your own answer." John Knox said, "I, for my part, praise my God that I see so honourable, and apparently
      so modest and quiet, an audience. But because it is long since I have heard that ye are one that is not ignorant of
      the truth, I must crave of you, in the name of God, yea, and I appeal to your conscience before that Supreme Judge
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_91">91</span> that, if ye think any Article there expressed to be contrary unto the
      truth of God, ye oppose yourself plainly unto it, and suffer not the people to be therewith deceived. But if in your
      conscience ye know the doctrine to be true, then I will crave your patronage thereto, that, by your authority, the
      people may be moved the rather to believe the truth, whereof many doubt by reason of our youth."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p213" shownumber="no"><i>Sub-prior.</i> I came not here as a judge, but only to talk familiarly, and therefore I will neither allow nor condemn;
      but, if you like, I will reason. Why may not the Kirk, for good causes, devise ceremonies to decorate the Sacraments
      and other of God's services?
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p214" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Because the Kirk ought to do nothing that is not of faith, and ought not to go before. She is bound to follow
      the voice of the true Pastor.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p215" shownumber="no"><i>Sub-prior.</i> It is in faith that the ceremonies are commended, and they have proper significations to help our faith.
      The hardess<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p215.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p215.1">97</a></sup><span class="mnote"

      the richness of the law, and the oil the softness of God's mercy. Likewise, every one of the ceremonies has a godly
      signification, and therefore they both proceed from faith, and are done in faith.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p216" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> It is not enough that man invent a ceremony, and then give it a signification, according to his pleasure. The
      ceremonies of the Gentiles, and to-day the ceremonies of Mahomet, might be so justified. If anything proceed from faith,
      it must have the Word of God for assurance; for ye are not ignorant that "faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the
      Word of God." Now, if ye would prove that your ceremonies proceed from faith and do please God, ye must prove that
      God in expressed words has commanded them. Else ye shall never prove that they proceed from faith, nor yet that they
      please God. Ye will but show that they are sin, and do displease Him, according to the words of the apostle, "Whatsoever
      is not of faith is sin."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p217" shownumber="no"><i>Sub-prior.</i> Will ye bind us so strait that we may do nothing without the express Word of God? What! If I ask a drink,
      do you think that I sin? I have not God's Word for<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_92">92</span> this. (It would appear
      that he gave this answer to shift over the argument upon Friar Arbuckle.)
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p218" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I would we should not jest in so grave a matter; neither would I that ye should begin to elude the truth with
      sophistry; but, if ye do, I will defend myself as best I can. As to your drinking, I say that, if ye either eat or
      drink without assurance of God's Word, in so doing ye ill-please God, and ye sin in your very eating and drinking.
      For, says the Apostle, speaking even of meat and drink, "the creatures are sanctified unto man, even by the Word and
      by prayer." The word is this: "All things are clean to the clean," and so forth. Now, let me hear thus much of your
      ceremonies, and I shall give you the argument; but I wonder that ye compare profane and holy things so indiscreetly.
      The question was not, and is not of meat and drink, wherein the Kingdom of God consists not, but the question is of
      God's true worshipping, without which we have no society with God. It is doubtful if, in the use of Christ's Sacraments,
      we may take the same freedom as we may do in eating and drinking. One meat I may eat, another I may refuse, and that
      without scruple of conscience. I may change one for another, as often as I please. May we do the same in matters of
      religion? May we cast away what we please, and retain what we please? If I recollect aright, Moses, in the name of
      God, says to the people of Israel, "All that the Lord thy God commands thee to do, that do thou to the Lord thy God:
      add nothing to it; diminish nothing from it." By this rule, I think, the Kirk of Christ should measure God's religion,
      and not by that which seems good in their own eyes.

</p>
<p id="iii.i-p222" shownumber="no"><i>Arbuckle.</i> I will even prove that these ye damn be ordained of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p223" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> The proof thereof I would gladly hear.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p224" shownumber="no"><i>Arbuckle.</i> Says not Saint Paul, that "another foundation than Jesus Christ may no man lay. But upon this foundation
      some build gold, silver, and precious stones; some hay, stubble, and wood." The gold, silver, and precious stones are
      the ceremonies of the Church, which do abide the fire, and consume not away. This place of Scripture is most plain.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p225" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i>—I praise my God, through Jesus Christ, for I find His promise sure, true, and stable. Christ Jesus bids us "not
      fear, when we shall be called before men, to give confession of His truth;" for He promises that "it shall be given
      unto us in that hour what we shall speak." If I had sought the whole Scripture, I could not have produced a place more
      proper for my purpose, nor more potent to confound you. Now, to your argument. The Ceremonies of the Kirk, say ye,
      are gold, silver, and precious stones, because they are able to abide the fire; but I would learn of you, what fire
      is it that your Ceremonies abide? And in the meantime, until ye be advised how to answer, I will show my mind, and
      make an argument against yours upon the same text. First, I have heard the text adduced for a proof of purgatory; but
      for defence of Ceremonies, I have never heard or yet read of its use. Omitting whether ye understand the mind of the
      Apostle or not, I make my argument, and say, that which may abide the fire may abide the Word of God. Your Ceremonies
      cannot abide the Word of God: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i> they cannot abide the fire; and if they cannot abide
      the fire, they are not gold, silver, nor precious stones. Now, if ye find any ambiguity in the term "fire," which I
      interpret to be the Word, find me a fire by the which things builded upon Jesus Christ should be tried, other than
      God and His Word, which are both called fire in the Scriptures, and I shall correct my argument.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p226" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_94">94</span></p>
<p id="iii.i-p227" shownumber="no"><i>Arbuckle.</i> I stand not thereupon; but I deny your minor argument, to wit, that our Ceremonies may not abide the trial
      of God's Word.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p228" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I prove that that which God's Word condemns, abides not the trial of God's Word. But God's Word condemns your
      Ceremonies: therefore they do not abide the trial thereof. As the thief abides the trial of the inquest, and is thereby
      condemned to be hanged, even so may your Ceremonies abide the trial of God's Word, but not otherwise. And now I make
      plain in few words that wherein ye may seem to doubt, to wit, that God's Word damns your Ceremonies. This thing is
      evident; for the plain and straight commandment of God is, "Not that thing which appears good in thy eyes shalt thou
      do to the Lord thy God, but what the Lord thy God has commanded thee, that do thou: add nothing to it; diminish nothing
      from it." Now, unless ye be able to prove that God has commanded your Ceremonies, this His former commandment will
      damn both you and them.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p229" shownumber="no">The Friar, somewhat abashed what first to answer, fell into a foul mire while he wandered about in the mist: for, alleging
      that we may not be so bound by the Word, he affirmed that the Apostles had not received the Holy Ghost when they did
      write their Epistles; but that they did ordain the Ceremonies after they received Him. (Few would have thought that
      so learned a man would have given so foolish an answer; and yet it is even as true as that he bare a grey cowl.) John
      Knox, hearing the answer, started and said, "If that be true, I have long been in an error, and I think I shall die
      therein." The Sub-prior said to him, "Father, what say ye? God forbid that ye affirm that; for then farewell the ground
      of our faith." The Friar, astonished, made the best shift that he could to correct his fall; but it could not be. John
      Knox brought him often again to the ground of the argument; but he would never answer directly, but ever fled to the
      authority of the Kirk. Thereto the said John answered oftener than once that "the spouse of Christ had neither power
      nor authority against the Word of God." Then said the Friar, "If so be, ye will leave us no Kirk." "Indeed," said the
      other, "in<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_95">95</span> David I read that there is a church of the malignants, for
      he says, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odi ecclesiam malignantium</i>.' That church ye may have without the Word, and
      therein ye may do many things directly fighting against the Word of God. If ye choose to be of that Church, I cannot
      impede you. But, as for me, I will be of none other Church than that which hath Christ Jesus to be pastor, which hears
      His voice, and will not hear a stranger."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p230" shownumber="no">In this Disputation many other things were merely skiffed over; for the Friar, after his fall, could speak nothing to a purpose.
      For purgatory he had no better proof than the authority of Virgil in his sixth Æneid; and the pains thereof to him
      were an evil wife. How John Knox answered that and many other things, he did witness in a treatise that he wrote in
      the galleys. This contained the sum of his doctrine and the confession of his faith, and was sent to his familiars
      in Scotland; with the exhortation that they should continue in the truth which they had professed, notwithstanding
      any worldly adversity that might ensue. Thus much of the Disputation have we inserted here, to the intent that men
      may see how Satan ever travails to obscure the light; and how God by His power, working in His weak vessels, confounds
      his craft and discloses his darkness.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p231" shownumber="no">After this, neither Papists nor Friars had great heart for further disputation or reasoning; but they invented another shift,
      which appeared to proceed from godliness. It was an ordinance that learned men in the Abbey and in the University should
      preach in the Parish Kirk, Sunday about. The Sub-prior began, next came the Official called Spittal (sermons penned
      to offend no man), and all the rest followed in their ranks. John Knox smelled out the craft, and in the sermons which
      he made upon the week-days he prayed to God that they should be as busy in preaching when there should be more myster

"Always," said he, "I praise God that Christ Jesus is preached, and nothing is said publicly
      against the doctrine ye have heard. If in my absence they shall speak anything which in my presence they

      to be quiet, because<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_97">97</span> they should see remedy before long. And so it proved;
      for upon the second last day of June there appeared in sight of the Castle of Saint Andrews twenty-one French galleys,
      with a powerful army, the like whereof was never seen in that firth before.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p234" shownumber="no">By these means the Governor, the Archbishop, the Queen and Monsieur D'Oysel had treasonably broken the terms of the Appointment.
      To excuse their treason, they had, eight days before, presented to the party in the Castle of St. Andrews an absolution
      bearing to be sent from Rome, containing, after the aggravation of the crime, this clause, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Remittimus Irremissible</i>,
      that is, we remit the crime that cannot be remitted. When this had been considered by the most of the company that
      was in the Castle, answer was given that the Governor and Council of the Realm had promised them a sufficient and assured
      absolution, such as that did not appear to be; and that therefore they could not deliver the house, nor did they think
      that any reasonable man would require them so to do, considering that the promise made had not been truly kept.

      (the gunners' goddess) helped them nothing; for they lost many of their rowers, men chained in the galleys, and some
      soldiers, both by sea and land. And further, a galley that approached nearer than the rest was so dung with the cannon
      and other ordnance, that she was stopped under water, and so almost drowned. Indeed, so she would have been, were it
      not that the rest gave her succour in time, and drew her first to the west sands, beyond the shot of the Castle, and
      thereafter to Dundee. There they remained until the Governor, who then was at the siege of Langhope, came unto them,
      with the rest of the French faction.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p236" shownumber="no">By land the siege of the Castle of St. Andrews was made complete on the nineteenth day of July. Trenches were cast; and ordnance
      was planted upon the Abbey Kirk, and upon<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_98">98</span> Saint Salvator's College. This
      so annoyed the Castle that they could keep neither their block-houses, the sea tower head, nor the west wall; for in
      all these places men were slain by great ordnance. Yea, they mounted the ordnance so high upon the Abbey Kirk, that
      they might discover the ground of the close in divers places. Moreover, the pest was within the Castle, and divers
      died thereof. This affrighted some that were therein more than did the external force without. John Knox was of another
      opinion, for he ever said that their corrupt life could not escape the punishment of God: that he continually asserted,
      from the time that he was called to preach. When they triumphed of their victory, and during the first twenty days
      they had many prosperous chances, he lamented, and ever said that they saw not what he saw. When they bragged of the
      strength and thickness of their walls, he said that they should prove but egg-shells. When they vaunted, "England will
      rescue us," he said, "Ye shall not see them; but ye shall be delivered into your enemies' hands, and shall be carried
      to a strange country."

      The lower trance was condemned, divers were slain in it, and the east block-house was shot off from the rest of the
      place between ten and eleven o'clock. Then fell a shower of rain that continued nearly an hour. The like of it had
      seldom been seen. It was so vehement that no man might abide without shelter. The cannons were left alone. Some within

      That they should be safely transported to France; and in case that, upon conditions that should be offered unto them
      by the King of France, they could not be content to remain in service and freedom there, they should, upon the expense
      of the King of France, be safely conveyed to such country as they should require, other than Scotland. They would have
      nothing to do with the Governor, nor with any Scotsman; for these had all traitorously betrayed them, "and this," said
      the Laird of Grange, elder, a simple man of most stout courage, "I am assured God will revenge before long."

      Rouen. There the principal gentlemen, who looked for freedom, were dispersed, and put in sundry prisons. The rest were
      left in the galleys, and there miserably treated. Amongst these was the foresaid Master James Balfour, with his two
      brethren, David and Gilbert, men without God. We write this because we hear that the said Master James, principal misguider
      now of Scotland, denies that he had anything to do with the Castle of St. Andrews, or that ever he was in the galleys.
      In breach of express promises (but Princes have no fidelity further than for their own advantage), these things were
      done at Rouen, and then the galleys departed to Nantes, in Brittany, where they lay upon the water of Loire the whole
      winter.

</div>
<p id="iii.i-p244" shownumber="no">This same year, 1547, in the beginning of September, an army of ten thousand men from England entered Scotland, by land,
      and some ships with ordnance came by sea. The Governor and the Archbishop, informed of this, gathered together the
      forces of Scotland and assembled at Edinburgh. The Protector of England, with the Earl of Warwick, and their army,
      remained at Preston, and about Prestonpans: for they had certain offers to propose unto the nobility of Scotland. These
      concerned the promises formerly made by them to King Harry. Before his death, he had gently required them to stand
      fast; and had undertaken that, if they would do so, they should have no trouble from him or his kingdom, but rather
      the help and comfort that he could give them in all things lawful. On this subject, a letter was now directed to the
      Governor and Council; but this fell into the hands of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, who, thinking that it could not
      be for his advantage that it should be divulged, suppressed it by his craft.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p244.1">The Battle of Pinkie Cleuch.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p245" shownumber="no">Upon Friday, the ninth of September, the English army marched towards Leith, and the Scottish army marched from Edinburgh
      to Inveresk. The whole Scottish army was not assembled, and yet skirmishing began; for nothing was expected but victory
      without a stroke. The<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_101">101</span> Protector, the Earl of Warwick, the Lord Gray,
      and all the English captains were playing at the dice: no men were stouter than the priests and canons, with their
      shaven crowns and black jacks. The Earl of Warwick and the Lord Gray, who had the chief charge of the horsemen, perceiving
      the host to be molested by the Scottish prickers, and that the multitude were neither under order nor obedience (for
      they were divided from the great army), sent forth certain troops of horsemen, and some of their borderers, either
      to fight them, or else to put them out of their sight, so that they might not annoy the host. The skirmish grew hot,
      and at length the Scotsmen gave back, and fled without once turning. The chase continued far, both towards the east
      and towards the west. Many were slain, and he that now is Lord Home was afterwards surrendered to the Englishmen. The
      loss of these men neither moved the Governor, nor yet the Archbishop, his bastard brother. They would revenge the matter
      well enough upon the morrow; for they were hands enough (no word of God): the English heretics had no faces; they would
      not abide.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p246" shownumber="no">Upon the Saturday, the armies of both sides arrayed themselves. The English army took the mid part of Falside Hill, having
      their ordnance planted before them, and their ships and two galleys brought as near the land as the water would allow.
      The Scottish army stood at first in a reasonably strong position and in good order, having betwixt them and the English
      army the water of Esk, otherwise called Musselburgh Water. At length, on the Governor's behalf, with sound of trumpet,
      order was given that all men should march forward, and go over the water. Some say that this was procured by the Abbot
      of Dunfermline, and Master Hugh Rigg, for preservation of Carberry. Men of judgment did not like the move; for they
      thought it no wisdom to leave their strong position. But commandment upon commandment, and charge upon charge were
      given, and, thus urged, they obeyed unwillingly. The Earl of Angus was in the vanguard, and had in his company the
      gentlemen of Fife, Angus, Mearns, and the Westland, with many others that for love resorted to him<span class="pb"
            id="iii.i-Page_102">102</span> and especially those that were professors of the Evangel; for they supposed that England
      would not make great pursuit of him. He passed first through the water, and arrayed his host directly before the enemies.
      The Earl of Huntly, and his Northland men followed. Last came the Duke, having in his company the Earl of Argyll, with
      his own friends, and the body of the realm.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p247" shownumber="no">The Englishmen, perceiving the danger, and that the Scotsmen intended to take the top of the hill, made haste to prevent
      the peril. The Lord Gray was commanded to give the charge with his men of arms. This he did, albeit the hazard was
      very unlikely; for the Earl of Angus's host stood even as a wall. These received the first assaulters upon the points
      of their spears (which were longer than those of the Englishmen) so rudely that fifty horse and men of the first rank
      lay dead at once, without any hurt being done to this Scots army, except that the spears of the two foremost ranks
      were broken. This discomfiture received, the rest of the horsemen fled; yea, some passed beyond Falside Hill. The Lord
      Gray himself was hurt in the mouth, and plainly refused to charge again; for, he said, "It was like running against
      a wall." The galleys, the ships, and the ordnance planted upon the mid hill shot terribly. The cross-fire of the ordnance
      of the galleys affrighted the Scots army wondrously. While every man laboured to draw from the north, whence the danger
      appeared, they began to reel, and at that point the English footmen were marching forward, albeit some of their horsemen
      were in flight. The Earl of Angus's army stood still, expecting that either Huntly or the Duke would rencounter the
      next battle; but it had been decreed that the favourers of England, and the heretics, as the priests called them, and
      the Englishmen should have the struggle to themselves for the day.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p248" shownumber="no">Panic arose, and, in an instant, those who before were victors and were not yet assaulted with any force, except with ordnance,
      as we have said, cast their spears from them and fled. Thus was God's power so evidently seen, that in one moment,
      yea, in one instant, both the armies were fleeing.<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_103">103</span> From the hill, from
      those that hoped for no victory upon the English part, the shout arose, "They flee, they flee." At the first it could
      not be believed, but at last it was clearly seen that all had given back; and then began a cruel slaughter, which was
      the greater by reason of the late displeasure of the men at arms.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p249" shownumber="no">The chase and slaughter extended almost to Edinburgh, upon the one part, and be-west Dalkeith upon the other. The number
      of the slain upon the Scottish side was judged to be nigh ten thousand men. The Earl of Huntly was taken, and carried
      to London; but he relieved himself, being surety for many ransoms. Whether he did so honestly or unhonestly we know
      not; but, as the bruit passed, he used policy with England. In the same battle was slain the Master of Erskine, dearly
      beloved of the Queen, who made great lamentation for him, and bare his death in mind for many days. When the certainty
      of the discomfiture came, she was in Edinburgh, waiting for tidings; but with expedition she posted that same night
      to Stirling, with Monsieur D'Oysel, who was as fleyed<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p249.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p249.1">106</a></sup>

      him to defend an unjust quarrel; albeit many innocents fell with the wicked. The English army came to Leith, and, after
      securing their prisoners and spoil, returned to England with this unlooked-for victory.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p250" shownumber="no">During the following winter, great hardships were inflicted upon all the Borders of Scotland. Broughty Craig was taken by
      the Englishmen, besieged by the Governor, but still kept. There Gavin, the best of the Hamiltons, was slain, and the
      ordnance lost. The Englishmen, encouraged, began to fortify the hill above Broughty House. The position was called
      the Fort of Broughty, and was very noisome<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p250.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p250.1">107</a></sup>

      with England.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p251" shownumber="no">At the Easter following, Haddington was fortified by the Englishmen. The most part of Lothian, from Edinburgh east,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_104">104</span> was either assured or laid waste. Thus did God plague in every quarter;
      but men were blind, and would not, or could not, consider the cause. The Lairds of Ormiston and Brunstone were banished,
      and afterwards forfeited, and so were all those of the Castle of St. Andrews.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p252" shownumber="no">The sure knowledge of the troubles of Scotland coming to France, there was prepared a navy and army. The navy was such as
      never was seen to come from France for the support of Scotland.... They arrived in Scotland in May 1549. Preparations
      were made for the siege of Haddington; but it was another thing that they meant, as the issue declared.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p252.1">The Parliament at Haddington: Queen Mary is sold to France.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p253" shownumber="no">The whole body of the realm having assembled, the form of a Parliament was held in the Abbey of Haddington. The principal
      head was the marriage to the King of France of the Princess, who had formerly been contracted to King Edward; and her
      immediate transfer to France, by reason of the danger to her from the invasion of our old enemies of England. Some
      were corrupted with buds,<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p253.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p253.1">108</a></sup>

      the officers of arms in that Parliament. The Laird of Buccleuch, a bloody man, sware, with many "God's wounds," that
      "they that would not consent should do worse." The Governor got the Duchy of Châtelherault, with the order of the Cockle,
      a full discharge of all intromissions with the treasure and substance of King James the Fifth, and possession of the
      Castle of Dumbarton, until issue of the Queen's body should be seen. Upon these and other conditions, he stood content
      to sell his sovereign. Huntly, Argyll, and Angus were likewise made knights of the Cockle; and, for that and other
      good deeds received, they also sold their interest. In short, none was found to resist that unjust demand; and so the
      Queen was sold to go to France, to the end that in her youth she should drink of the liquor that should remain with
      her all her lifetime, for a plague to this realm, and for her final destruction. Therefore, albeit there now comes
      out from her a fire that consumes many, let no<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_105">105</span> man wonder. She is the
      hand of God, who, in His displeasure, is punishing our former ingratitude....

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p253.2">The Siege of Haddington.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p254" shownumber="no">Once it was decided that our Queen, without further delay, should be delivered to France, the siege continued. There was
      great shooting, but no assaulting; and yet they had fair occasion offered unto them. For the Englishmen, approaching
      the town with powder, victuals, and men for the comforting of the besieged, lost an army of six thousand men. Sir Robert
      Bowes was taken prisoner, and the most part of the Borderers were either captured or slain. The town might justly have
      despaired of any further succour, but yet it held good; for the stout courage and prudent government of General Sir
      James Wilford did so inspire the whole captains and soldiers that they determined to die upon their walls. From the
      time that the Frenchmen had gotten the bone for which the dog barked, the pursuit of the town was slow. The siege was
      raised, and the Queen was conveyed by the west seas to France; and so the Cardinal of Lorraine got her into his keeping,
      a morsel meet for his own mouth....
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p255" shownumber="no">That winter Monsieur de Dessé remained in Scotland with the bands of Frenchmen. They fortified Inveresk, to prevent the English
      from invading Edinburgh and Leith. Some skirmishes there were betwixt the one and the other, but no notable thing was
      done, except that the French almost took Haddington, as we shall see.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p255.1">The French Fruits: Arrogance of the French Soldiery.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p256" shownumber="no">Thinking themselves more than masters in all parts of Scotland, and in Edinburgh principally, the French thought that they
      could do no wrong to any Scotsman. A certain Frenchman having delivered a culverin to George Tod, a Scotsman, to be
      stocked, he was bringing it through the street, when another Frenchman claimed it. He would have reft it from the said
      George; but he resisted, alleging that the Frenchman did wrong. Parties began to assemble to succour of the Scotsman,
      as well as to that of the Frenchman. Two of the Frenchmen were stricken down, and the rest were chased from the Cross
      to Niddrie's Wynd head. The Provost, being upon the street,<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_106">106</span> apprehended
      two of the French, and was carrying them to the Tolbooth; when from Monsieur de Dessé's lodging and close issued forth
      Frenchmen, to the number of threescore persons. These, with drawn swords, resisted the said Provost. But the town,
      assembling, repulsed them, until they came to the Nether Bow. There Monsieur de La Chapelle, with the whole bands of
      Frenchmen in arms, rencountered the said Provost and repulsed him (for the town was without weapons for the most part),
      and then attacked all that they met. In the throat of the Bow were slain David Kirke and David Barbour, who were at
      the Provost's back, and then were slain the said Provost himself, who was Laird of Stenhouse and captain of the Castle,
      James Hamilton, his son, William Chapman, a godly man, Master William Stewart, William Purves, and a woman, named Elizabeth
      Stewart. Thereafter the soldiers tarried within the town, by force, from five o'clock until after seven at night, and
      then retired to the Canongate, as to their receptacle and refuge.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p257" shownumber="no">The whole town, yea, the Governor and Nobility, commoved at the unworthiness of this bold attempt, craved justice upon the
      malefactors, and threatened that they would otherwise execute justice on the whole. The Queen, craftily enough, Monsieur
      de Dessé, and Monsieur D'Oysel laboured for pacification, and did promise that "unless the Frenchmen, by themselves
      alone, should do such an act as might recompense the wrong that they had done, they should not refuse that justice
      should be executed, with rigour."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p258" shownumber="no">These fair words pleased our fools, and the French bands were the next night directed to Haddington. They approached the
      town a little after midnight, so secretly that they were never espied until the foremost were within the base court,
      and the whole company in the churchyard, not two pair of butt-lengths from the town. The soldiers, Englishmen, were
      all asleep, except the watch, which was slender, and yet the shout was raised, "Bows and bills: bows and bills," which
      in all towns of war signifies need of extreme defence, to avoid present danger. The affrighted arose; weapons that
      first came to hand serving for the need. One amongst many came to the east port, where<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_107">107</span>      lay two great pieces of ordnance, and where the enemies were known to be. Crying to his fellows that were at the gate
      making defence, "Ware before," he fired a great piece, and thereafter another. God so conducted this discharge that,
      after it, no further pursuit was made. The bullets rebounded from the wall of the Friar Kirk, to the wall of St. Catherine's
      Chapel, which stood directly fornent it, and from the wall of the Chapel to the Kirk wall again, so often that there
      fell more than a hundred of the French, at those two shots only. The firing was continued, but the French retired with
      diligence, and returned to Edinburgh, without harm done, except the destruction of some drinking beer, which lay in
      the said Chapel and Kirk. Herein was ample satisfaction for the slaughter of the said captain and Provost, and for
      the slaughter of such as were slain with him. This was the beginning of the French fruits.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p259" shownumber="no">This winter also did the Laird of Raith most innocently suffer, the head of the said nobleman being stricken from him; especially
      because he was known to be one that unfeignedly favoured the truth of God's Word, and was a great friend to those that
      were in the Castle of St. Andrews. Of their deliverance, and of God's wondrous working with them during the time of
      their bondage, we must now speak, lest, in suppressing the record of so notable a work of God, we might justly be accused
      of ingratitude.

</div>
<p id="iii.i-p260" shownumber="no">The principals being confined in several houses, as before we have said, there was great labour to make them have a good
      opinion of the Mass. Chiefly was there travail with Norman Leslie, the Laird of Grange, and the Laird of Pitmilly,
      who were in the Castle of Cherbourg. Pressed to go to Mass with the captain, they answered that "The captain had commandment
      to keep their bodies, but he had no power to command their conscience." The captain replied that "He had power to command
      and to compel them to go where he would." They answered that "They would not refuse to go to any lawful place with
      him; but they would not, either for him or for the King, do anything that was against their conscience." The captain
      said,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_108">108</span> "Will ye not go to the Mass?" They answered, "No; and if ye would compel
      us, we will displease you further; for we will so use ourselves there that all those that are present shall know that
      we despite it."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p261" shownumber="no">Similar answers, and somewhat sharper, did William Kirkaldy, Peter Carmichael, and such as were with them in Mount St. Michael,
      give to their captain; for they said they would not only hear Mass every day, but that they would help to say it, provided
      that they might stick the priests. Master Henry Balnaves, who was in the Castle of Rouen, was most sharply assaulted
      of all; for, because he was judged learned, learned men were appointed to travail with him, and with them he had many
      conflicts. But, God so assisting him, they departed confounded, and he, by the power of God's Spirit, remained constant
      in the truth and profession of the same, without any wavering or declining to idolatry.

<p id="iii.i-p262" shownumber="no">These that were in the galleys were threatened with torments, if they would not give reverence to the Mass; but the French
      could never make the poorest of that company give reverence to that idol. Yea, when, upon the Saturday night, they

      their heads; and when others were compelled to kiss a painted board, which they called "Notre Dame," they were not
      pressed more than once; for this was what happened. Soon after the arrival at Nantes, their great <i>Salve</i> was
      sung, and a glorious painted Lady was brought to be kissed, and was presented to one of the Scotsmen then chained,
      amongst others. He gently said, "Trouble me not; such an idol is accursed; and therefore I will not touch it." The

<p id="iii.i-p265" shownumber="no">Master James Balfour being in the same galley as John Knox, and being wondrously familiar with him, would often ask his opinion
      whether he thought that they should ever be delivered. His answer ever was, from the day that they entered the galleys,
      that God, for His own glory, would deliver them from that bondage, even in this life. The second time that the galleys
      returned to Scotland, when they were lying betwixt Dundee and St. Andrews, and the said John was so extremely sick
      that few hoped his life, the said Master James willed him to look to the land, and asked if he knew it? He answered,

      I am fully persuaded that, however weak I may now appear, I shall not depart this life until my tongue shall glorify

      at freedom, they might safely take it: but that he would never consent to their shedding any man's blood for their
      freedom. He added, further, that he was assured that God would deliver them and the rest of that company, even in the
      eyes of the world; but not by such means as we had looked for; that was, by the force of friends or by their other
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_110">110</span> labours. He affirmed that they should not be delivered by such means,
      but that God would so work in the deliverance of them, that the praise thereof should redound to His glory only. He
      therefore urged every one to take any occasion for deliverance that God might offer, provided that nothing was done
      against God's express commandment.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p267" shownumber="no">John Knox was the more earnest in giving his counsel, because the old Laird of Grange, and others, were averse from their
      purpose, fearing lest the escaping of the others should be an occasion of their own worse treatment. Thereto the said
      John answered that such fear proceeded not from God's Spirit, but only from a blind love of self. No good purpose was
      to be stayed for things that were in the hands and power of God. In one instant, he added, God delivered all that company
      into the hands of unfaithful men, but so would He not relieve them. Some would He deliver by one means, and at one
      time, and others must, for a season, abide upon His good pleasure. In the end, they embraced this counsel. Upon the
      King's Even, when Frenchmen commonly drink liberally, the foresaid four persons, having the help and conduct of a boy
      of the house, bound all those that were in the Castle, put them in sundry houses, locked the doors upon them, took
      the keys from the captain, and departed without harm done to the person of any, or without touching anything that appertained
      to the King, the Captain, or the house.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p268" shownumber="no">Great search was made through the whole country for them. But it was God's good pleasure so to conduct them that they escaped
      the hands of the faithless, albeit it was with long travail, and endurance of great pain and poverty; for the French
      boy left them, and took with him the small poise that they had. Having neither money, nor knowledge of the country,
      and fearing that the boy should discover them, as in very deed he did, of purpose they divided themselves, changed
      their garments, and went in sundry parties. The two brethren, William and Robert Leslie (who now are become, the said
      Robert especially, enemies to Christ Jesus and to all virtue) came to Rouen. William Kirkaldy and Peter Carmichael,
      in beggars' garments, came to Le Conquet, and<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_111">111</span> for the space of twelve
      or thirteen weeks they travelled as poor mariners, from port to port, till at length they got a French ship, and landed
      in the west. From thence they came to England, where they met with the said John Knox, he and Alexander Clark having
      been delivered that same winter.

      parts of England, where he remained until the death of King Edward the Sixth. Then he left England, and went to Geneva,
      where he remained in his private study, until he was called to be preacher to the English congregation at Frankfort.
      This call he obeyed, albeit unwillingly, at the commandment of that notable servant of God, John Calvin. He remained
      at Frankfort until some of the learned, more given to unprofitable ceremonies than to sincerity of religion, began
      to quarrel with him. These men, because they despaired of prevailing before the magistrate there in the overt purpose
      of establishing their corruptions, accused him of treason committed against the Emperor, and against their sovereign
      Queen Mary, in that, in his <cite id="iii.i-p269.1">Admonition to England</cite>, he called the one little inferior
      to Nero, and the other more cruel than Jezebel. The magistrate, perceiving their malice and fearing that the said John
      should fall into the hands of his accusers by one means or another, gave secret warning to him to depart from the city;
      for they could not save him if he were required by the Emperor, or by the Queen of England, in the Emperor's name.
      So the said John returned to Geneva, from thence to Dieppe, and thereafter to Scotland, as we shall hear.

      thereafter recalled to Scotland, their peace was proclaimed, and they themselves were restored to their lands, in despite
      of their enemies. And that was done in hatred of<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_112">112</span> the Duke, and because
      France began to thirst to have the regiment of Scotland in her own hands. Howsoever it was, God made their enemies
      set them at liberty and freedom. There still remained a number of common servants in the galleys, but these were all
      delivered when the contract of peace was made betwixt France and England, after the taking of Boulogne. So was the

      at the table and sometimes in other privy places, he had read the Scriptures, and had given such exhortation as God
      pleased to give him, to such as pleased to hear him. "Knave," quoth one, "what have ye to do to meddle with the Scriptures?"
      "I think," said he, "it is the duty of every Christian to seek the will of his God, and the assurance of his salvation,
      where it is to be found, and that is within his Old and New Testament." "What then," said another, "shall we leave
      to the bishops and kirkmen to do, if every man shall be a babbler upon the Bible?" "It becometh you," said he, "to
      speak more reverently of God and of His blessed Word. If the judge were incorrupt, he would punish you for your blasphemy.
      To your question, I answer that, albeit ye and I and other five thousand within<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_114">114</span>      this realm should read the Bible, and speak of it what God should give us to speak, yet should we leave more to the
      bishops to do than either they will or yet can well do. We leave to them to preach the Evangel of Jesus Christ publicly,
      and to feed the flock which He hath redeemed with His own blood, and hath commended to the care of all true pastors.
      When we leave this unto them, methinks we leave to them a heavy burden; and we do them no wrong if we search our own
      salvation where it is to be found, considering that they are but dumb dogs, and unsavoury salt that has altogether
      lost its season." The Bishops, offended, said, "What prating is this? Let his accusation be read."

      Earl of Huntly disdainfully said, "Foolish man, wilt thou desire another judge than my Lord Duke's Grace, great Governor
      of Scotland, and my Lords the bishops, and the clergy here present?" Thereto he answered, "The bishops can be no judges
      of me; for they are open enemies to me and to the doctrine that I profess. And, as for my Lord Duke, I cannot tell
      if he has the knowledge that should be in him that should judge and discern betwixt lies and the truth, the inventions
      of men and the true worshipping of God. I desire God's Word," and with that he produced the Bible, "to be judge betwixt
      the bishops and me, and I am content that ye shall all hear. If by this book I shall be convicted to have taught, spoken,
      or done, in matters of religion, anything that repugns to God's will, I refuse not to die; but if I cannot be convicted,
      as I am assured by God's Word I shall not be, then I in God's name desire your assistance, that malicious men may not
      execute unjust tyranny upon me." The Earl of Huntly said, "What a babbling fool this is. Thou shalt get none other

      Adam prepared to answer. As to the baptizing of his own child, he said, "It was and is as lawful to me, for lack of
      a true minister, to baptize my own child, as it was to Abraham to circumcise his son Ishmael and his family. And as
      for purgatory, praying to saints, and praying for the dead, I have read both the New and Old Testaments often, but

      the misery of this life on the sixth of July 1553. The death of this Prince was lamented by all the godly within Europe;
      for the graces given unto him by God, by nature as well as through erudition and godliness, passed the measure that
      is commonly given to other Princes in their greatest perfection, and yet he exceeded not sixteen years of age. What
      gravity beyond his years, what wisdom passing all expectation of man, and what dexterity in answering all questions

      as in the other; but that provident eye of the Eternal our God, who continually watches for preservation of His Church,
      did so dispose all things, that Satan shortly after found himself far disappointed in his conclusions. For in the cruel

      She did with much greediness drink of that fountain, and at her death she expressed the fruit of her hearing, to the
      great comfort of all those that repaired to her. Albeit she suffered most grievous torment in her body, from her mouth
      there was heard nothing but praising of God, except that sometimes she would lament the troubles of those that were
      troubled by her. When her sisters asked what she thought of the pain which she then suffered in body, in comparison
      with that with which sometimes she had been troubled in spirit, she answered, "A thousand years of this torment, and
      ten times more joined unto it, is not to be compared to the quarter of an hour that I suffered in my spirit. I thank

      all your abominations. That which ye call your Sacrament and Christ's body, as ye have deceived us to believe in times

      thereafter she slept in the Lord Jesus, to the no small comfort of those that saw her blessed departing. We could not

</div>
<p id="iii.i-p284" shownumber="no">At the first coming of the said John Knox, divers who had a zeal to godliness made small scruple to go to the Mass, or to
      communicate with the abused sacraments in the papistical manner. Perceiving this, he began, in privy conference as
      well as in preaching, to show the impiety of the Mass, and how dangerous it was to participate in any way with idolatry.
      The consciences of some were affrighted, and the matter began to agitate from man to man. So the said John was called
      to supper by the Laird of Dun for that purpose, and there were convened David Forrest, Master Robert Lockhart, John
      Willock, and William Maitland of Lethington, younger, a man of good learning, and of sharp wit and reasoning. The question
      was proposed, and it was answered by the said John that it was nowise lawful to a Christian to present himself to that
      idol. Nothing was omitted that might make for the temporiser, and yet was every head fully answered, and especially
      one wherein they thought their great defence stood, to wit, that Paul, at the commandment of James and the elders of
      Jerusalem, went to the temple and feigned to pay his vow with others. After a full discussion, William Maitland concluded,
      saying, "I see perfectly that our shifts will serve nothing before<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_120">120</span> God,
      seeing that they stand us in so small stead before man."
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p285" shownumber="no">The answer of John Knox to the act of Paul, and to the commandment of James, was that Paul's act had nothing to do with their
      going to the Mass. To pay vows was sometimes God's commandment, and was never idolatry: but the Mass was from the beginning,
      and still remained odious idolatry. "Secondarily," said he, "I greatly doubt whether either James's commandment or
      Paul's obedience proceeded from the Holy Ghost...." After these and like reasonings, the Mass began to be abhorred
      by such as before had frequented it for the fashion, and for avoidance of slander, as then they termed it.

      of St. Andrews, and now Earl of Moray, came to Calder and so approved his doctrine that they expressed a desire that
      it should have been public. That same winter he taught commonly in Edinburgh; and, after Yule, on the invitation of

      When he returned to Calder, divers from Edinburgh, and from the country about, assembled there, for the preaching as
      well as for the right use of the Lord's Table, which they had never practised before. Thence he departed the second

      the most part of the gentlemen of Mearns. To the praise of God, these do, to this day, constantly adhere to the doctrine
      which then they professed, to wit, that they refused all society with idolatry, and bound themselves to maintain, to
      the uttermost of their powers, the true preaching of the Evangel of Jesus Christ, as God should offer unto them preachers
      and opportunity.

      He bade farewell in almost every congregation in which he had preached, and exhorted us to prayers, to reading of the
      Scriptures, and to mutual conference, until such time as God should give unto us greater liberty. By the procurement
      and labours of Robert Campbell of Kinyeancleuch, he visited the old Earl of Argyll in the Castle of Campbell, and there
      he taught certain days. The Laird of Glenorchy, being one of his auditors, desired the Earl of Argyll to detain him;
      but he, purposed upon his journey, would not at that time stay for any request. He added that, if God so blessed these
      small beginnings and they continued in godliness, they should find him obedient whensoever they pleased to command
      him; but that he must needs visit once that little flock which the wickedness of men had compelled him to leave. In
      the month of July he left this realm and passed to France, and so to Geneva. Immediately after, the bishops summoned
      him, and, for non-compearance, burned him in effigy at the Cross of Edinburgh, in the year of God 1555.

      began publicly to preach in Dundee; and so did divers others in Angus and Mearns. And last, in God's good pleasure,
      John Willock arrived the second time from Embden; and his return was so joyful to the brethren that their zeal and
      godly courage daily increased. Albeit he contracted a dangerous sickness, he did not cease from labour, but taught
      and exhorted from his bed. Some of the nobility (of whom some are fallen back, among whom the Lord Seton is chief),
      with many barons and gentlemen, were his auditors. These were instructed in godliness by him, and wondrously comforted.
      They kept their conventions, and held councils with such gravity and closeness, that the enemies trembled. The images
      were stolen away in all parts of the country; and in Edinburgh the great idol called Saint Giles was first drowned
      in the Nor' Loch, and then burned. This raised no small trouble in the town.

      Yet she consented to summon the preachers; and the Protestants, neither offended nor yet afraid, determined to keep
      the day of summons, as that they did. When the<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_124">124</span> prelates and priests
      perceived this, they procured that there should be made a proclamation that all men that were come to the town without
      commandment of the authority, should with all diligence repair to the Borders, and there remain fifteen days: for the
      Bishop of Galloway, in this manner of rhyme, said to the Queen, "Madam, Because they are come without order, I red

      to complain of their strange entertainment, considering that her Grace had found in them faithful obedience in all
      things lawful. When the Queen began to craft, a zealous and a bold man, James Chalmers of Gadgirth, said, "Madam, we

      to get again the old Saint Giles, or else at their own expense to make a new image. The Council answered that to them
      the charge appeared very unjust; for they understood that God in some places had commanded idols and images to be destroyed.
      Where He had commanded images to be set up, they had not read; and they desired the Bishop to find a warrant for his

      was there to lead the ring, but the Queen Regent herself, with all her shavelings, for honour of that feast. West about
      it went, and came down the High Street, and down to the Canon Cross. The Queen Regent dined that day in Sandy Carpetyne's
      house, betwixt the Bows, and so, when the idol returned again, she left it, and went to her dinner. The hearts of the
      brethren were wondrously inflamed, and, seeing such abomination so manifestly maintained, were determined to be revenged.
      They were divided into several companies, of which not one knew
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_126">126</span> of another. There were some temporisers that day (amongst whom David

<p id="iii.i-p299" shownumber="no">Immediately after the Queen had entered the lodging, some of those that were in the enterprise drew nigh to the idol, as
      if willing to help to bear him, and getting the fertour upon their shoulders, began to shudder, thinking that thereby
      the idol should have fallen. But that was provided for and prevented by the iron nails, as we have said; and so one
      began to cry, "Down with the idol; down with it;" and without delay it was pulled down. One took him by the heels and,

      father would have tarried four such." The priest's patrons made some brag at the first; but when they saw the feebleness
      of their god, priests and Friars fled faster than they did at Pinkie Cleuch. Then might have been seen so sudden a
      fray as seldom has been amongst that sort of men within this realm. Down went the crosses, off went the surplice, and
      the round caps cornered with the crowns.

      house; such a sudden fray amongst the generation of Antichrist within this realm never came before. By chance, there
      lay upon a stair a merry Englishman, who, seeing that the discomfiture was without blood, thought he would add some
      merriness to the matter, and so cried he over the stair, and said, "Fie upon you, why have ye broken order? Down the
      street ye passed in array and with great mirth. Why flee ye now, villains, without order? Turn and strike everyone
      a stroke for the honour of his god. Fie, cowards, fie, ye shall never be judged worthy of your wages again!" But exhortations
      were then unprofitable; for, after Baal had broken his neck, there was no comfort to his confused army.

      so indifferent that many were of the opinion that he was not far from the Kingdom of God. Such as feared God had begun
      to have a good opinion of him, and the Friars and others of that sect had begun to whisper that if he did not take
      heed to himself and to his doctrine he would be the destruction of the whole estate of the Kirk. But his hypocrisy
      could not long be cloaked; for, when he learned of this change in public opinion, he promised a sermon, in which he
      should give his judgment upon all such heads as were then in controversy in the matters of religion. The bruit hereof
      secured him a great audience at the first; but he so handled himself that day that no godly man did credit him after
      that. Not only gainsaid he the doctrine of Justification and of prayer, which before he had taught, but he also set
      up and maintained the Papistry to the uttermost prick; yea, holy water, pilgrimage, purgatory, and pardons were of
      such virtue in his conceit that he looked not to be saved without them.

      dissuaded them therefrom, affirming that if ever they disputed—except where they themselves were both judge and party,
      and where fire and sword should obey their decree—their cause was wrecked for ever. Their victory, he said, stood neither
      in God nor in His Word, but in their own wills, and in the things concluded by their own councils, together with sword
      and fire, "and thereto," said he, "these new start-up fellows will give no place. They will call you to your account
      book, the Bible; and by it ye will no more be found the men that ye are called, than the Devil will be proven to be
      God. And therefore, if ye love yourselves, never enter into disputation; nor yet call ye the matter in question; but
      defend your possession, or else all is lost." Caiaphas could not give a better counsel to his companions; but God disappointed

      made mention that new consultation was appointed for final conclusion of the matter before purposed, and desired me
      therefore to abide in these parts until the determination of the same. The other letter was direct from a gentleman

      to deny that ever they did consent to any such purpose, if any trial or question should be taken thereof, etc. Which
      letters, when I had considered, I partly was confounded, and partly was pierced with anguish and sorrow. Confounded
      I was, that I had so far travelled in the matter, moving the same to the most godly and the most learned that this

      against you, because he would that ye should prefer your worldly rest to God's praise and glory, and the friendship
      of the wicked to the salvation of your brethren. I am not ignorant that fearful troubles shall ensue your enterprise,
      as in my former letters I did signify unto you; but O joyful and comfortable are those troubles and adversities which
      man sustaineth for accomplishment of God's will, revealed by His Word! For, however terrible they appear to the judgment
      of the natural man, yet are they never able to devour nor utterly to consume the sufferers. For the invisible and invincible

<p id="iii.i-p314" shownumber="no">First, it is thought expedient, devised, and ordained, that in all parishes of this realm the common prayers be read,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_132">132</span> weekly on Sunday, and on the other festival days, publicly in the parish
      kirks, with the lessons of the New and Old Testament, conform to the order of the Book of Common Prayers: and, if the
      curates of the parishes be qualified, to cause them to read the same; and, if they be not, or if they refuse, that
      the most qualified in the parish use and read the same.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p315" shownumber="no">Secondly, it is thought necessary that doctrine, preaching, and interpretation of Scriptures be had and used privately in
      quiet houses, without great conventions of the people thereto, until afterwards God move the Prince to grant public
      preaching by faithful and true ministers.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p315.1">The Earl of Argyll promotes the Cause of the Reformed Kirk.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p316" shownumber="no">These two heads concerning the religion and some others concerning the policy being concluded, the old Earl of Argyll, took
      the maintenance of John Douglas, caused him to preach publicly in his house, and reformed many things according to
      his counsel. Divers others took the same boldness within towns as well as to landward; and this did not a little trouble
      the bishops and Queen Regent.... Shortly after this, God in His mercy called the said Earl of Argyll from the miseries
      of this life. The bishops were glad; for they thought that their great enemy was taken out of the way; but God disappointed
      them. For the said Earl departed most firmly adhering to the true faith of Jesus Christ, with a plain renunciation
      of all impiety, superstition, and idolatry; and in his testament he directed his son to study to set forward the public
      and true preaching of the Evangel of Jesus Christ, and to suppress all superstition and idolatry, to the uttermost
      of his power.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.i-p316.1">The Bishops make a feeble Show of Reformation.
</div>
<p id="iii.i-p317" shownumber="no">The bishops continued in their Provincial Council. That they might give some show to the people that they proponed reformation,
      they spread abroad a rumour of this, and published a printed manifesto, which the people dubbed "The Twa-penny Faith."
      Amongst the Acts of the Council, there was much ado (1) for caps, shaven crowns, tippets, long gowns, and such other
      trifles: (2) That none should enjoy office or benefice ecclesiastical, except a priest: (3) That no Kirk-man should
      nourish his own bairns in his own company; but that every one should hold the<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_133">133</span>      children of others: (4) That none should put his own son in his own benefice: (5) That, if any were found in open adultery,
      for the first fault, he should lose the third of his benefice; for the second crime, the half; and for the third, the
      whole benefice. The Bishop of Moray, and other prelates, appealed against these Acts, saying that they would abide
      by the Canon law. And this might they well enough do, so long as they remained interpreters, dispensers, makers, and
      disannullers of that law....

      had not at that time obtained from the Scots Parliament. It was desired that the crown-matrimonial should be granted
      to Francis, husband to our Sovereign, so that France and Scotland should be one kingdom, the subjects of both realms
      having equal liberty, Scotsmen in France, and Frenchmen in Scotland. The glister<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.i-p318.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.i-p318.1">124</a></sup>

      wind caused that most suddenly to vanish away; for the greatest offices and benefices within the realm were given to
      Frenchmen. Monsieur de Ruby kept the Great Seal. Villemore was Comptroller. Melrose and Kelso were to be a Commend

      they were compelled to pay toll and taxations other than their ancient liberties did bear.
</p>
<p id="iii.i-p319" shownumber="no">To get the matrimonial crown, the Queen Regent left no point of the compass unsailed. With the bishops and priests she practised
      in this manner. "Ye may clearly see that I cannot do what I would within this realm; for these heretics and confederates
      of England are so bound together, that they stop all good order. But, if ye be favourable unto me in this suit of the
      matrimonial crown to be granted to my daughter's husband, ye shall see how I shall handle these heretics and traitors
      before long." And truly, in these promises she meant<span class="pb" id="iii.i-Page_134">134</span> no deceit in this
      respect. To the Protestants she said, "I am not unmindful how often ye have suited me for reformation in religion,
      and gladly would I consent thereunto; but ye see that the power and craft of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, together
      with the power of the Duke, and of the Kirkmen, are ever bent against me in all my proceedings. So that I can do nothing,
      unless the full authority of this realm be devolved to the King of France, and this cannot be except by donation of
      the crown-matrimonial. If ye will bring this to pass, then devise ye what ye please in matters of religion, and they
      shall be granted."

<p id="iii.ii-p2" shownumber="no">Lest Satan shall take occasion of our long silence to blaspheme, and to slander us the Protestants of the realm of Scotland

      a great part of the nobility and barons of the realm, to take the sword of just defence against those that most unjustly
      have sought our destruction. In this our Confession we shall faithfully declare what moved us to take action, what
      we have asked, and what we require of the sacred authority. Our cause being thus made known, our enemies as well as

      persecuted by France and by their faction. Thus, too, our brethren, natural Scotsmen, of whatever religion they be,
      may have occasion to examine themselves as to whether they may with safe conscience oppose themselves to us. We only
      seek that the glorious Evangel of Christ Jesus may be preached, His holy Sacraments be truly ministered, superstition,
      tyranny, and idolatry be suppressed in this realm, and the liberty of this our native country remain free from the

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p3.1">The Consciences of Judges, Lords, and Rulers are awakened.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p4" shownumber="no">While the Queen Regent practised with the prelates, how the blessed Evangel of Christ Jesus might be utterly suppressed within
      Scotland, God so blessed the labours of His weak servants that no small part of the Barons of this realm began to abhor
      the tyranny of the bishops. God did so open their eyes by the light of His Word, that they could clearly discern betwixt
      idolatry and the true honouring of God. Yea, men almost universally began to doubt whether they might give their bodily
      presence to the Mass without offending God, or offer their children for papistical baptism. When the most godly and
      the most learned in Europe had answered these doubts, both by word and writing, affirming that we might do neither,
      without extreme peril to our souls, we began to be more troubled. Then also, men of estimation, who bore rule amongst
      us, began to examine themselves concerning their duties towards reformation of religion, as well as towards the just
      defence of their most cruelly persecuted brethren. And so divers questions began to be moved, to wit, whether such
      as were judges, lords, and rulers of the people might, with safe conscience, serve the superior powers in maintaining
      idolatry, in persecuting their brethren, and in suppressing Christ's truth? Or, whether they, to whom God had in some
      cases committed the administration of justice, might suffer the blood of their brethren to be shed in their presence,
      without any declaration that such tyranny displeased them? By the plain Scripture it was found that a lively faith
      required a plain confession, when Christ's truth was attacked; that not only are they guilty that do evil, but so also
      are they that assent to evil. It is plain that they that assent to evil, seeing iniquity openly committed, do by their
      silence seem to justify and allow what is done.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p5" shownumber="no">These things being sufficiently proven by evident Scriptures of God, every man began to look more diligently to his salvation;
      for the idolatry and tyranny of the clergy, called the Churchmen, was and is so manifest, that whoever doth deny it
      declares himself ignorant of God, and enemy to Christ Jesus. We therefore, with humble confession of our former offences,
      began, with fasting and supplication unto God, to seek<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_137">137</span> some remedy
      in so present a danger. At the outset it was decided that the brethren in every town should at certain times assemble
      together for common prayers, and for exercise and reading of the Scriptures, until it should please God to give the
      sermon of exhortation to some, for comfort and instruction of the rest.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p5.1">The Office of Elder is instituted, and the Privy Kirk is founded.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p6" shownumber="no">God did so bless our weak beginning that, within a few months, the hearts of many were so strengthened that we sought to
      have the face of a Church amongst us, and to have open crimes punished, without respect of person. For that purpose,
      by common election, elders were appointed. To them the whole brethren promised obedience; for at that time we had no
      public ministers of the Word; but certain zealous men, amongst whom were the Laird of Dun, David Forrest, Master Robert
      Lockhart, Master Robert Hamilton, William Harlaw, and others, exhorted their brethren, according to the gifts and graces
      granted unto them. Shortly after did God stir up His servant, Paul Methven (whose latter fall ought not to deface the
      work of God in him), and he in boldness of spirit began openly to preach Christ Jesus in Dundee, in divers parts of
      Angus, and in Fife. God did so work with him that many began openly to renounce their old idolatry, and to submit themselves
      to Christ Jesus, and unto His blessed ordinances. In consequence, the town of Dundee began to erect the face of a public
      Church Reformed, and in this the Word was openly preached, and Christ's Sacraments were truly ministered.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p6.1">John Willock preaches: formal Steps towards a Public Reformation are taken.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p7" shownumber="no">In the meantime God did send to us our dear brother, John Willock, a man godly, learned, and grave, who, after short abode
      at Dundee, repaired to Edinburgh. There, notwithstanding his long and dangerous sickness, he so encouraged the brethren
      by godly exhortations, that we began to deliberate upon some public Reformation; for the corruption in religion was
      such that, with safe conscience, we could no longer sustain it. Yet, because we would attempt nothing without the knowledge
      of the sacred authority, with one consent, after the deliberation of many days, it was concluded that by our public
      and common<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_138">138</span> supplication we should attempt to secure the favour, support,
      and assistance of the Queen, then Regent, towards a godly reformation. For that purpose, after we had prepared our
      oration and petitions, we appointed from amongst us a man whose age and years deserved reverence, whose honesty and
      worship might have craved audience of any magistrate on earth, and whose faithful service to the authority at all times
      had been such that on him could fall no suspicion of unlawful disobedience. This orator was that ancient and honourable
      father, Sir James Sandilands of Calder, knight, to whom we gave commission and power in all our names then present,
      before the Queen Regent thus to speak:—

      of those wrongs and of that sore grief patiently borne by us in bodies and minds for so long a time; yet are we now,
      of very conscience and by the fear of our God, compelled to crave, at your Grace's feet, remedy against the most unjust
      tyranny used against your Grace's most obedient subjects, by those that are called the Estate Ecclesiastical. Your
      Grace cannot be ignorant what controversy hath been, and yet is, concerning the true religion, and the right worshipping
      of God, and how the clergy, as they desire to be termed, usurp to themselves such empire above the consciences of men
      that whatsoever they command must be obeyed, and whatsoever they forbid must be avoided, without further respect to
      God's pleasure, commandment, or will, revealed to us in His most holy Word; or else there abideth nothing for us but
      faggot, fire, and sword. By these means, many of our brethren have been stricken most cruelly and most unjustly of
      late years within this realm. This now we find to trouble and wound our consciences; for we acknowledge it to have
      been our bounden duty before God, either to have defended our brethren from those cruel murderers, seeing we are a
      part of that power which God hath established<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_139">139</span> in this realm, or else
      to have given with them open testification of our faith. Now we ourselves offer to do this, lest we shall seem to justify
      their cruel tyranny by our continual silence.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p9" shownumber="no">"This condition of affairs doth not only displease us, but as your Grace's wisdom most prudently doth foresee, for the quieting
      of this intestine dissension, a public Reformation, in religion as well as in temporal government was most necessary.
      To this task, as we are informed, ye have most gravely and most godly exhorted as well the clergy as the nobility,
      to employ their study, diligence, and care. We, therefore, of conscience, dare no longer dissemble in so weighty a
      matter which concerneth the glory of God and our salvation. Neither now dare we withdraw our presence, or conceal our
      petitions, lest the adversaries hereafter shall object to us that place was granted to reformation, and yet no man
      suited for the same; and so should our silence be prejudicial unto us in time to come. Therefore, knowing no other
      order placed in this realm, but your Grace, in your grave Council, set to amend, as well the disorder ecclesiastical,
      as the defaults in the temporal regiment, we most humbly prostrate ourselves before your feet, asking your justice,
      and your gracious help, against them that falsely traduce and accuse us, as if we were heretics and schismatics. Under
      that colour they seek our destruction; because we seek the amendment of their corrupted lives, and that Christ's religion
      be restored to its original purity. Further, we crave of your Grace to hear, with open and patient ears, these our
      subsequent requests; and, to the joy and satisfaction of our troubled consciences, mercifully to grant the same, unless
      by God's plain Word any be able to prove that justly they ought to be denied.

      riches and possessions rather than zealously desiring their amendment and salvation, do travail and labour for this

      Articles of Reconciliation. These stipulated that we should permit the<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_142">142</span>      Mass to remain in reverence and estimation, grant purgatory after this life, confess prayer to saints and for the dead,
      and suffer them to enjoy their accustomed rents, possession, and honour. Upon these terms, they were prepared to grant
      us freedom to pray and baptize in the vulgar tongue, if this were done secretly, and not in the open assembly.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p17" shownumber="no">The grossness of these articles was such, that with one voice we refused them; and continued to crave justice from the Queen
      Regent, and a reasonable answer to our former petitions. The Queen Regent, a woman crafty, dissimulate, and false,
      thinking to make profit of both parties, gave us permission to conduct ourselves in godly manner, according to our
      desires, provided that we should not make public assemblies in Edinburgh or Leith; and she promised her assistance
      to our preachers, until some uniform order might be established by a Parliament. To the clergy, she quietly gave signification
      of her mind, promising that, as soon as opportunity should serve, she should so arrange matters for them that they
      should have no more trouble. Some say that they gave her a large purse,—40,000 pounds, says the Chronicle gathered
      by Sir William Bruce, the Laird of Earlshall. Unsuspecting of her doubleness and falsehood, we were fully contented
      with her answer; and did use ourselves so quietly that, for her pleasure, we put silence to John Douglas. He would
      have preached publicly in the town of Leith; but in all things we sought the contentment of her mind, so far as we
      should not offend God by obeying her in things unlawful.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p17.1">Persecution at St. Andrews: Walter Myln is burned.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p18" shownumber="no">Shortly after these things, that cruel tyrant and unmerciful hypocrite, falsely called Archbishop of St. Andrews, apprehended
      that blessed martyr of Christ Jesus, Walter Myln; a man of decrepit age, whom most cruelly and most unjustly he put
      to death by fire in St. Andrews, the twenty-eighth day of April, the year of God 1558. This did highly offend the hearts
      of all godly, and immediately after his death a new fervency arose amongst the whole people; yea, even in the town
      of St. Andrews, the people began plainly to damn such unjust cruelty. In testification that the death of Walter Myln
      would abide<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_143">143</span> in recent memory, there was cast together a great heap
      of stones at the place where he was burned. The Archbishop and the priests, offended, caused this to be removed once
      or twice, with denunciation, by cursing, of any man who should there lay a stone. But their breath was spent in vain;
      for the heap was always renewed, until the priests and papists did by night steal away the stones to build their walls,
      and for other their private uses.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p19" shownumber="no">Having no suspicion that the Queen Regent approved of the murder of Walter Myln, we did most humbly complain of this unjust
      cruelty, requiring that justice in such cases should be administered with greater indifference.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.ii-p19.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.ii-p19.1">131</a></sup>

      innocent. She declared that sentence had been given without her knowledge, because the man had been a priest at one
      time; and the Archbishop's officer had prosecuted him without any commission from the civil authority, <i>ex officio</i>,
      as they term it.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p19.2">The Protestants appeal to Parliament.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p20" shownumber="no">Still unsuspicious, we required some order to be taken against such enormities; and this she promised, as she had often done
      before. But because a Parliament was to be held shortly after, for certain affairs pertaining rather to the Queen's
      particular profit than to the commodity of the commonwealth, we thought good to expose our matter unto the whole Parliament,
      and from them to seek some redress. Therefore, with one consent, we did offer to the Queen and Parliament a letter
      in this tenor:—
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p21" shownumber="no">"Unto your Grace, and unto you, Right Honourable Lords of this present Parliament, humbly mean and show your Grace's faithful
      and obedient subjects: That we are daily molested, slandered, and injured by wicked and ignorant persons, place-holders
      of the ministers of the Church, who most untruly cease not to infame us as heretics, and under that name most cruelly
      have persecuted divers of our brethren, and further intend to execute their malice against us, unless by some godly
      order their fury and rage be bridled and<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_144">144</span> stayed. Yet in us they are
      able to prove no crime worthy of punishment, unless it be that to read the Holy Scriptures in our assemblies, to invocate
      the name of God in public prayers, with all sobriety to interpret and open the places of Scripture that be read, to
      the further edification of the brethren assembled, and truly according to the holy institution of Christ Jesus to minister
      the Sacraments, are crimes worthy of punishment. Of other crimes they are not able to convict us.... Most humbly require
      we of your Grace, and of your right honourable Lords, Barons, and Burgesses assembled in this present Parliament, prudently
      to weigh, and, as becometh just judges, to grant these our most just and reasonable petitions:—
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p22" shownumber="no">"Firstly, ... We most humbly desire that all such Acts of Parliament, as in the time of darkness gave power to the Churchmen
      to execute their tyranny against us, by reason that we were delated heretics, may be suspended and abrogated until
      a General Council, lawfully assembled, shall have decided all controversies in religion.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p23" shownumber="no">"Secondly, Lest this mutation should seem to set all men at liberty to live as they list, we require that it be enacted by
      this present Parliament that the prelates and their officers be removed from the place of judgment; granting unto them,
      not the less, the place of accusers in the presence of a temporal judge, before whom the Churchmen shall be bound to
      call any accused by them of heresy....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p24" shownumber="no">"Thirdly, We require, that all lawful defences be granted to the persons accused.... Also, that place be granted to the party
      accused to explain and interpret his own mind and meaning; which confession we require to be inserted in public Acts,
      and to be preferred to the depositions of any witnesses, seeing that none that is not found obstinate in his damnable
      opinion ought to suffer for religion.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p25" shownumber="no">"Lastly, We require, that our brethren be not damned for heretics, unless, by the manifest Word of God, they be convicted
      to have erred from that faith which the Holy Spirit witnesseth to be necessary to salvation....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p26" shownumber="no">"These things require we to be considered by you, who<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_145">145</span> occupy the place of
      the Eternal God, who is God of order and truth, even in such sort as ye will answer in the presence of His throne judicial.
      And we require, further, that ye will favourably have respect to the tenderness of our consciences, and to the trouble
      which apparently will follow in this commonwealth, if the tyranny of the Prelates and of their adherents be not bridled
      by God and just laws. God move your hearts deeply to consider your own duties and our present troubles."
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p26.1">The Regent makes large Promises of Protection and Reform.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p27" shownumber="no">These petitions did we first present to the Queen Regent, because we were determined to enterprise nothing without her knowledge,
      most humbly requiring her favourable assistance in our just action. She spared not amiable looks, and good words in
      abundance; but she kept our bill in her pocket. When we required secretly of her Grace that our Petitions should be
      proposed to the whole Assembly, she answered that she did not think that expedient; for then would the whole ecclesiastical
      Estate be contrary to her proceedings. These at that time were great; for the matrimonial crown was asked, and in that
      Parliament granted. "But," said she, "as soon as order can be taken with these things, which now may be hindered by
      the Kirkmen, ye shall know my good mind; and, in the meantime, whatsoever I may grant unto you shall gladly be granted."
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p28" shownumber="no">Still suspecting nothing of her falsehood, we were content to give place for a time to her pleasure and pretended reason.
      Yet we thought expedient to protest somewhat before the dissolution of Parliament; for our Petitions were manifestly
      known to the whole Assembly, as also that, for the Queen's pleasure, we ceased to pursue the uttermost....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p29" shownumber="no">Our protestations were publicly read, and we desired that they should be inserted in the common register; but by labours
      of enemies that was denied unto us. Nevertheless, the Queen Regent said, "Me will remember what is protested; and me
      shall put good order after this to all things that now be in controversy." Thus, after she had by craft obtained her
      purpose, we departed in good hope of her favours, praising<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_146">146</span> God in our
      hearts that she was so well inclined towards godliness. The good opinion that we had of her sincerity caused us not
      only to spend our goods and hazard our bodies at her pleasure, but also, by our public letters written to that excellent
      servant of God, John Calvin, we did praise and commend her for excellent knowledge in God's Word and her good-will
      towards the advancement of His glory; requiring of him that, by his grave counsel and godly exhortation, he would animate
      her Grace constantly to follow that which in godly fashion she had begun. We did further sharply rebuke, both by word
      and writing, all such as appeared to suspect any venom of hypocrisy in her, or were contrary to that opinion which
      we had conceived of her godly mind.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p29.1">Treachery of the Regent: the Preachers are summoned.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p30" shownumber="no">Suddenly, it became certain that we were deceived in our opinion, and abused by her craft. As soon as all things pertaining
      to the commodity of France were granted by us, and peace was contracted betwixt King Philip and France, and England
      and us, she began to spue forth, and disclose the latent venom of her double heart. She began to frown, and to look
      frowardly upon all such as she knew to favour the Evangel of Jesus Christ. She commanded her household to use all abominations
      at Easter; and she herself, to give example to others, did communicate with that idol, the Mass, in open audience;
      she controlled her household, and would know where every one received the Sacrament. It is supposed that after that
      day the Devil took more violent and strong possession in her than he had before; for, from that day forward, she appeared
      altogether altered, insomuch that her countenance and acts did declare the venom of her heart.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p31" shownumber="no">When, incontinently, the Queen caused our preachers to be summoned, we made intercession for them, beseeching her Grace not
      to molest them then in their ministry, unless any man were able to convict them of false doctrine. But she could not
      bridle her tongue from open blasphemy, and proudly said, "In despite of you and of your ministers both, they shall
      be banished out of Scotland, albeit they preached as truly as ever did St. Paul." This proud and blasphemous answer
      did
      <span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_147">147</span> greatly astonish us; and yet ceased we not most humbly to seek her
      favour, and by great diligence at last secured that the summonses should be delayed. Alexander, Earl of Glencairn,
      and Sir Hugh Campbell of Loudoun, knight, Sheriff of Ayr, were sent to reason with her, and to crave some performance
      of her manifold promises. To them she answered that it became not the subjects to burden their Princes with promises,
      further than it pleaseth them to keep these. Both these noblemen faithfully and boldly discharged their duty, and plainly
      forewarned her of the inconveniences that were to follow. Thereupon, somewhat astonished, she said she would advise.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p31.1">The Revival at Perth: Fury of the Regent.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p32" shownumber="no">In the meantime the town of Perth, called St. Johnston, embraced the truth, and this did provoke her to a new fury; in which
      she urged the Lord Ruthven, Provost of that town, to suppress all such religion there. He replied that he could make
      their bodies come to her Grace, and prostrate themselves before her, until she was fully satiate of their blood, but
      that he could not promise to force them to act against their conscience. In a fury, she said that he was too malapert
      to give her such answer, and affirmed that both he and they should repent it. She solicited Master John Haliburton,
      Provost of Dundee, to apprehend Paul Methven, but he, fearing God, gave secret warning to the man to leave the town
      for a time. At Easter, she sent forth men whom she thought most able to persuade, with commission to induce Montrose,
      Dundee, St. Johnston, and such other places as had received the Evangel, to communicate with the idol of the Mass;
      but they had no success. The hearts of many were bent to follow the truth revealed, and did abhor superstition and
      idolatry.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p33" shownumber="no">More angry than ever, she again summoned all the preachers to appear at Stirling, on the tenth day of May 1559. With all
      humble obedience, we sought means to appease her, and save our preachers from being molested. When it was seen that
      we could not prevail, the whole brethren agreed that the gentlemen of every county should accompany their preachers
      on the day appointed. All men were most willing; and for<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_148">148</span> that purpose
      the town of Dundee, and the gentlemen of Angus and Mearns, proceeded with their preachers to Perth, without armour,
      as peaceable men, desiring only to give confession with their preachers. Lest such a multitude should raise the apprehensions
      of the Queen Regent, the Laird of Dun, a zealous, prudent, and godly man, went before to the Queen, who was then in
      Stirling. To her he declared that the cause of their convocation was only to give confession with their preachers,
      and to assist them in their just defence. She, understanding the fervency of the people, began to craft with him, soliciting
      him to stay the multitude, and also the preachers, promising that she would make some better arrangements. He, a man
      most gentle of nature, and most willing to please her in all things not repugnant to God, wrote requesting those that
      then were assembled at Perth to stay, and not to come forward, and informed them of the Queen's promise and the hope
      he had of her favour.... So did the whole multitude tarry at Perth with their preachers.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p33.1">John Knox returns from France, and joins the Protestants at Perth.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p34" shownumber="no">In the meantime, on the second of May 1559, John Knox arrived from France. Lodging two nights only in Edinburgh, and hearing
      the day appointed to his brethren, he repaired to Dundee. There he earnestly required that he might be permitted to
      assist his brethren, and to give confession of his faith with them. This granted to him, he departed to Perth with
      them; and there he began to exhort, according to the grace of God granted to him. The Queen, perceiving that the preachers
      did not obey her summons, began to utter her malice; and, notwithstanding any request made to the contrary, gave commandment
      to put them to the horn,<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.ii-p34.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.ii-p34.1">132</a></sup>

      was perceived by the Laird of Dun, he prudently withdrew himself; for otherwise, by all appearance, he would not have
      escaped imprisonment. In this belief he was justified by the fact that the Master of Maxwell, a man zealous and stout
      in God's cause, as it then appeared, was, under the cloak of another small crime, that same day<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_149">149</span>      put under arrest, because he did boldly affirm that, to the uttermost of his power, he would assist the preachers and
      the congregation, notwithstanding any sentence which was, or should be, unjustly pronounced against them. The Laird
      of Dun, coming to Perth, expounded the case, and concealed nothing of the Queen's craft and falsehood.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p34.2">The Mob wreck the Churches and destroy the Monasteries in Perth.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p35" shownumber="no">The multitude, when they understood the Queen's treachery, were so inflamed that neither could the exhortation of the preachers
      nor the commandment of the magistrate stay them from destroying the places of idolatry. What happened was as follows.
      The preachers had declared how odious was idolatry in God's presence; what commandment He had given for the destruction
      of the monuments thereof; and what idolatry and what abomination was in the Mass. It chanced that the next day, the
      eleventh of May, after the sermon which had been vehement against idolatry, a priest in contempt insisted upon going
      to the Mass; and, to declare his malapert presumption, he opened up a glorious tabernacle which stood upon the high
      altar. Certain godly men were present, and amongst others a young boy, who cried with a loud voice, "It is intolerable
      that, when God by His Word hath plainly damned idolatry, we shall stand and see it used in despite." The priest, offended,
      gave the child a great blow; who in anger took up a stone, and casting it at the priest, did hit the tabernacle and
      broke down an image.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p36" shownumber="no">Immediately the whole multitude cast stones, and laid hands on the said tabernacle, and on all other monuments of idolatry.
      These they dispatched before the tenth part of the town's people were made aware, for the most part were gone to dinner.
      These deeds noised abroad, the whole multitude came together, not the gentlemen or those that were earnest professors,
      but the rascal multitude. Finding nothing to do in that church, these ran without deliberation to the Grey and Black
      Friars, and, notwithstanding that these monasteries had within them very strong guards for their defence, their gates
      were forthwith burst open. Idolatry was the occasion of the first outburst, but thereafter the common people began
      <span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_150">150</span> to look for spoil. In very deed, the Grey Friars was so well provided
      that unless honest men had seen it, we would have feared to report what provision they had. Their sheets, blankets,
      beds, and coverlets were such that no Earl in Scotland had better; their napery was fine. There were but eight persons
      in the convent, and yet there were found eight puncheons of salt beef (consider the time of the year, the eleventh
      day of May), wine, beer, and ale, besides store of victuals of the same sort. A like abundance was not found in the
      monastery of the Black Friars; and yet there was more than became men professing poverty. The poor were permitted to
      take the spoil; but no honest man was enriched by the value of a groat. For the preachers had before threatened all
      men, that for covetousness' sake none should put their hand to such a Reformation.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p37" shownumber="no">The conscience of the spoilers did so move them, that they suffered those hypocrites to take away what they could. The Prior
      of Charter-house was permitted to take away with him as much gold and silver as he was well able to carry. So had men's
      consciences before been beaten with the Word, that they had no respect to their own particular profit, but only to
      abolish idolatry, and the places and monuments thereof. In this they were so busy and so laborious that, within two
      days, these three great places, monuments of idolatry, to wit, the monasteries of the Grey and Black thieves and that
      of the Charter-house monks (a building of a wondrous cost and greatness) were so destroyed that only the walls remained.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p38" shownumber="no">When the Queen heard what had happened, she was so enraged that she vowed utterly to destroy Perth, man, woman, and child,
      to consume the place by fire, and thereafter to salt it, in sign of a perpetual desolation. Suspecting nothing of such
      beastly cruelty, but thinking that such words might escape her in choler without forethought, because she was a woman
      set afire by the complaints of those hypocrites who flocked unto her as ravens to carrion, we returned to our own houses,
      leaving John Knox in Perth to instruct the people, because they were young and rude in Christ. But she continued in
      her rage, set afire partly by her own malice, partly by commandment<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_151">151</span>      of her friends in France, and not a little by the bribes which she and Monsieur D'Oysel received from the bishops and
      the priests here at home.

      First. By these and other persuasions, she made the majority of them consent to attack us. And then in haste she sent
      for her Frenchmen; for it was ever her joy to see Scotsmen dipped in one another's blood. No man was at that time more
      frack against us than was the Duke, led on by that cruel beast, the Archbishop of St. Andrews, and by those that yet
      abuse him, the Abbot of Kilwinning and Matthew Hamilton of Millburn, two chief enemies to Christ Jesus; yea, enemies
      to the Duke himself and to his whole house, in so far as at least they may procure their own particular profit. These
      and such other pestilent papists ceased not to cast faggots on the fire, continually crying, "Forward upon these heretics;
      we shall for once and all rid this realm of them."
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p40" shownumber="no">Hearing of this, some of us repaired to Perth again about the twenty-second day of May, and there we did abide for the comfort
      of our brethren. After invocation of the name of God, we began so to fortify the town and ourselves in the manner that
      we thought might prove best for our just defence. And, because we were not utterly despaired of the Queen's favour,
      we drew up a letter to her Grace, as followeth:—
</p>
<blockquote id="iii.ii-p40.1">


      <p id="iii.ii-p41" shownumber="no">"<span class="sc" id="iii.ii-p41.1">To the Queen's Grace Regent</span>, all humble obedience and duty premised. As
            heretofore, with jeopardy of our lives, and yet with willing hearts, we have served the authority of Scotland,
            and your Grace, now Regent in this realm, in service dangerous and painful to our bodies; so now, with most dolorous
            minds we are constrained by unjust tyranny purposed against us to declare unto your Grace, that, unless this
            cruelty be stayed by your wisdom, we will be compelled to take the<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_152">152</span>            sword of just defence against all that shall pursue us for the matter of religion, and for our conscience' sake;
            which ought not, nor may not, be subject to mortal creatures, farther than by God's Word man be able to prove
            that he hath power to command us.
      </p>


      <p id="iii.ii-p42" shownumber="no">"We signify moreover unto your Grace, that if by rigour we be compelled to seek the extreme defence, we will not only
            notify our innocence and petitions to the King of France, to our Mistress and to her husband, but also to the
            Princes and Council of every Christian realm, declaring unto them that this cruel, unjust, and most tyrannical
            murder, intended against towns and multitudes, was and is the only cause of our revolt from our accustomed obedience,
            which, in God's presence, we faithfully promise to our Sovereign Mistress, to her husband, and unto your Grace
            Regent; provided that our consciences may live in that peace and liberty which Christ Jesus hath purchased unto
            us by His blood; and that we may have His Word truly preached, and holy Sacraments rightly ministrate unto us,
            without which we firmly purpose never to be subject to mortal man. For we think it better to expose our bodies
            to a thousand deaths than to hazard our souls to perpetual condemnation, by denying Christ Jesus and His manifest
            verity, which thing not only do they that commit open idolatry, but also all such as, seeing their brethren unjustly
            pursued for the cause of religion, and having sufficient means to comfort and assist them, do not-the-less withdraw
            from them their dutiful support.

<p id="iii.ii-p45" shownumber="no">In the same tenor we wrote to Monsieur D'Oysel in French, requiring of him that, by his wisdom, he would mitigate the Queen's
      rage, and the rage of the priests; and warning him that otherwise that flame, then beginning to burn, would so kindle
      that it could not be slockened. We added that he declared himself no faithful servant to his<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_153">153</span>      master the King of France if, for the pleasure of the priests, he persecuted us, and so compelled us to take the sword
      of just defence. In like manner we wrote to Captain Serra la Burse, and to all other captains and French soldiers in

      commandment from their master. We besought them, therefore, not to provoke us to enmity against them, considering that
      they had found us favourable in their most extreme necessities. We declared further unto them that, if they entered
      into hostility and bloody war against us, this should continue longer than their and our lives, to wit, even in all
      posterity to come, so long as natural Scotsmen should have power to revenge such cruelty, and most horrible ingratitude....

<p id="iii.ii-p46" shownumber="no">Our letters were suppressed to the uttermost of the power of the enemy, and yet they came to the knowledge of many. But the
      rage of the Queen and priests could not be stayed; and they moved forward against us: we were then but a very few and
      mean number of gentlemen in Perth. Perceiving the extremity to approach, we wrote to all brethren enjoining them to
      repair towards us for our relief. To this we found all men so readily bent, that the work of God was evident. And,
      because we wished to leave nothing undone that would declare our innocency to all men, we addressed a letter to those
      of the nobility who then persecuted us....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p47" shownumber="no">When our letters were divulged, some man began to reason whether of conscience it would be right to make war upon us, considering
      that we offered due obedience to the authority, and required nothing but liberty of conscience, and that our religion
      and actions should be tried by the Word of God. Our letters came with convenient expedition to the hands of the brethren
      in Cunningham and Kyle. These convened at the Kirk of Craigie, where, after some contrarious reasons, Alexander, Earl
      of Glencairn, in zeal, burst forth in these words, "Let every man serve his conscience. I will, by God's grace, see
      my brethren in Perth; yea, albeit never man should<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_154">154</span> accompany me, I
      will go, were it but with a pike upon my shoulder; for I had rather die with that company than live after them." These
      words so encouraged the rest that all decided to go forward, and that they did so stoutly that, when Lion Herald, in
      his coat armour, by public sound of trumpet in Glasgow, commanded all men under pain of treason to return to their
      houses, never man obeyed that charge, but all went forward....

      that purpose chose a platt of ground, distant a mile and more from the town. In the meantime the Lord Ruthven, Provost
      of Perth, and a man whom many judged godly and stout in that action (as in very deed he was, even unto his last breath),
      left the town, and departed first to his own place, and afterwards to the Queen. His defection and revolt was a great
      discouragement to the hearts of many; and yet God did so comfort that, within the space of twelve hours after, the
      hearts of all men were erected again. Those then assembled did not so much hope for victory by their own strength,
      as by the power of Him whose truth they professed; and they began to comfort one another, until the whole multitude

</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p52" shownumber="no">"Firstly, I most humbly require of you, my Lords, to say to the Queen's Grace Regent, in my name, that we whom she in her
      blind rage doth persecute are God's servants, and faithful and obedient subjects to the authority of this realm; that
      that religion which she pretendeth to maintain by fire and sword is not the true religion of Christ Jesus, but is expressly
      contrary to it, a superstition devised by the brain of man; which I offer myself to prove against all that within Scotland
      will maintain the contrary, liberty of tongue being granted to me, and God's written Word being admitted for judge.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p53" shownumber="no">"And, secondly, I farther require your Honours to say unto her Grace, in my name, that, as I have already written, so now
      I say that this enterprise of hers shall not prosper in the end; and albeit for a time she trouble the saints of God,
      she does not fight against man only, but against the eternal God and His invincible truth; and the end shall be her
      confusion, unless she repent and desist betimes.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p54" shownumber="no">"These things I require of you, in the name of the eternal God, to say unto her Grace as from my mouth; adding that I have
      been and am a more assured friend to her Grace than are these servants to her corrupt appetites, who either flatter
      her, or else inflame her against us. We seek nothing but the advance of God's glory, suppression of vice, and the maintenance
      of truth in this poor realm."
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p55" shownumber="no">All three did promise to report these words so far as they could, and we learned afterwards that they did so. Yea, the Lord
      Semple himself, a man sold under sin, enemy to God and to all godliness, yet made such report that the Queen was somewhat
      offended that any man should use such liberty in her presence. She still proceeded in her malice; for she sent her
      Lion Herald immediately after with letters in which all men were straitly charged to quit the town, under pain of treason.
      After he had declared these letters to the chief<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_156">156</span> men of the congregation,
      the Herald proclaimed them publicly, upon Sunday, the twenty-eighth of May.

</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p56" shownumber="no">In the meantime, sure knowledge came to the Queen, to the Duke, and to Monsieur D'Oysel, that the Earl of Glencairn, the
      Lords Ochiltree and Boyd, the young Sheriff of Ayr, the Lairds of Craigie-Wallace, Cessnock, Carnell, Barr, Gadgirth,
      and the whole congregation of Kyle and Cunningham, approached for our relief. In very deed they came with such diligence,
      and in such a number that the enemy had just cause to fear, and all that professed Christ Jesus had just matter to
      praise God for their fidelity and stout courage in that need; for the tyranny of the enemy was bridled by their presence....
      Their number was estimated at twenty-five hundred men, and of these twelve hundred were horsemen. The Queen, understanding
      how the said Earl and Lords approached with their company, caused all ways to be beset, so that no information should
      come to us, and that we, despairing of support, might consent to the terms required by her. At the same time, she sent
      to require that some discreet men of our number should come and speak with the Duke and Monsieur D'Oysel (who lay with
      their army at Auchterarder, ten miles from Perth) for the purpose of making some reasonable appointment....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p57" shownumber="no">From us were sent the Laird of Dun, the Laird of Inverquharity, and Thomas Scott of Abbotshall to learn what appointment
      the Queen would offer. The Duke and Monsieur D'Oysel required that access to the town should be given, and that all
      matters in dispute should be referred to the Queen's pleasure. To this they answered that neither had they commission
      so to promise, nor durst they conscientiously persuade their brethren to agree to such a promise. But, they said, if
      the Queen's Grace would promise that no inhabitant of the town should be troubled for any such crimes as might be alleged
      against them for the late change of religion, and the abolition of idolatry and downcasting of the places of idolatry;
      and if she would suffer that the religion begun should continue, and would on her departure leave the town free from
      the garrisons of<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_157">157</span> French soldiers, they for their part would labour
      to secure from their brethren that the Queen should be obeyed in all things.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p58" shownumber="no">Monsieur D'Oysel perceived the danger to be great, should a speedy appointment not be made. He saw, also, that they would
      not be able to execute their tyranny against us after the congregation of Kyle, of whose coming we had no information,
      should be joined with us. So, with good words, he dismissed the said Lords to persuade the brethren to quiet concord.
      All men were well disposed to this course, and with one voice they cried, "Cursed be they that seek effusion of blood,
      war, or dissension. Let us possess Christ Jesus, and the benefit of His Evangel, and none within Scotland shall be
      more obedient subjects than we shall be." After the coming of the Earl of Glencairn was known, the enemy quaked for
      fear, and with all expedition there were sent from Stirling again the Earl of Argyll and the Lord James, in company
      with a crafty man, Master Gavin Hamilton, Abbot of Kilwinning, to finish the appointment foresaid....

</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p59" shownumber="no">With the Earl of Glencairn came our loving brother John Willock; John Knox was in the town already. These two went to the
      Earl of Argyll and Prior, and accused them of disloyalty, in that they had defrauded their brethren of their dutiful
      support and comfort in time of their greatest necessity. They both answered that their heart was constant with their
      brethren, and that they would defend the cause to the uttermost of their power. But because they had promised to labour
      for concord and to assist the Queen should we refuse reasonable offers, conscience and honour did not permit them to
      do less than be faithful in their promise made. Therefore, they required that the brethren might be persuaded to consent
      to that reasonable appointment; promising, in God's presence, that, if the Queen did break in any jot thereof, they,
      with their whole powers, would assist and co-operate with their brethren in all times to come. This promise made, the
      preachers appeased the multitude, and ultimately secured the consent of all men to the appointment foresaid; although
      they did not obtain this without great labour. And no wonder, for many foresaw the<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_158">158</span>      danger to follow; yea, the preachers themselves, in open sermon, did affirm plainly that they were assuredly persuaded
      that the Queen did not mean to act in good faith. But, to stop the mouth of the adversary, who unjustly accused us
      of rebellion, they most earnestly required all men to approve the appointment, and so to suffer hypocrisy to disclose
      itself. The appointment was concluded on the twenty-eighth of May, and on the day following the Congregation departed
      from Perth....

Honest and indifferent
      men asked why she did so manifestly violate her promise. She answered that she was bound to keep no promise to heretics;
      and, moreover, that she had only promised to leave the town free of French soldiers. This last she said she had done,
      because those that were left were Scotsmen. When it was reasoned, to the contrary, that all those who took wages of
      France were accounted French soldiers, she answered, "Princes must not so straitly be bound to keep their promises.
      Myself," said she, "would make little conscience to take from all that sort their lives and inheritance, if I might

      cruelly treated the majority of the citizens that remained.

<p id="iii.ii-p64" shownumber="no">The Earl of Argyll, and Lord James, perceiving in the Queen nothing but mere tyranny and falsehood, and mindful of their
      former promises to their brethren, secretly conveyed themselves and their companies from the town. With them departed
      the Lord Ruthven, the Earl of Menteith, and the Laird of Tullibardine.... The Queen, highly offended at the sudden
      departure of these persons, charged them to return, under the highest pain of her displeasure. But they answered that
      they could not, with safe conscience, be partakers in so manifest tyranny as that committed by her, and in the great
      iniquity which they perceived to be devised by her and her ungodly Council, the<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_160">160</span>      prelates. This answer was given to her on the first day of June, and immediately the Earl of Argyll and Lord James
      repaired toward St. Andrews, and in their journey intimated to the Laird of Dun, to the Laird of Pittarrow, to the
      Provost of Dundee, and to other professors in Angus, their desire that they should visit them in St. Andrews on the
      fourth of June, that Reformation might be made there. This they did, bringing John Knox in their company.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.ii-p64.1">The Archbishop of St. Andrews interdicts Knox from preaching.
</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p65" shownumber="no">The Archbishop, hearing of Reformation to be made in his cathedral Church, thought it time to stir if ever he were to do
      so. He assembled his colleagues and confederate fellows, besides his other friends, and came to the town upon the Saturday
      night, accompanied by a hundred spears, desiring to have stopped John Knox from preaching. The two Lords and gentlemen
      foresaid were only accompanied by their quiet households, and the sudden coming of the Archbishop was the more fearful;
      for the Queen and her Frenchmen having departed from Perth, were then lying in Falkland, within twelve miles of St.
      Andrews. Besides, the town had not at that time given profession of Christ, and therefore the Lords could not be assured
      of their friendship. After consultation, many were of opinion that the preaching should be delayed for that day, and
      especially that John Knox should not preach; for the Archbishop had affirmed that he would not suffer this, seeing
      that the picture of the said John had formerly been burned by his commandment. He instructed an honest gentleman, Robert
      Colville of Cleish, to say to the Lords that did John Knox present himself at the preaching place in his town and principal
      church, he should "gar<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.ii-p65.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.ii-p65.1">135</a></sup>

<p id="iii.ii-p66" shownumber="no">After long deliberation, the said John was called, that his own judgment might be had. Many persuasions were used to induce
      him to delay for that time, and great terrors were threatened if he should enterprise such a thing, in seeming contempt
      of the Archbishop. But he answered, "God is witness that I never<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_161">161</span> preached
      Christ Jesus in contempt of any man, nor am I disposed at any time to present myself at that place, from respect to
      my own private commodity, or to the worldly hurt of any creature; but I cannot conscientiously delay to preach to-morrow,
      unless my body be violently withholden. In this town and church, God first began to call me to the dignity of a preacher.
      From this I was reft by the tyranny of France, by procurement of the bishops, as ye all know well enough. How long
      I continued prisoner, what torment I sustained in the galleys, and what were the sobs of my heart, it is now no time
      to recite. This only I cannot conceal. More than one have heard me say, when the body was far absent from Scotland,
      that my assured hope was that I should preach in St. Andrews in open audience before I departed this life.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p67" shownumber="no">"Therefore," said John Knox, "my Lords, seeing that God hath, beyond the expectation of many, brought me in the body to the
      place where first I was called to the office of a preacher, and from the which most unjustly I was removed, I beseech
      your Honours not to stop me from presenting myself unto my brethren. As for the fear of danger that may come to me,
      let no man be solicitous. My life is in the custody of Him whose glory I seek; and therefore I cannot so fear their
      boast or tyranny as to cease from doing my duty, when of His mercy He offereth occasion. I desire the hand or weapon
      of no man to defend me; only do I crave audience. If this be denied here to me at this time, I must seek further where
      I may have it."

      the eleventh of June. In his sermon he treated of the ejection of the buyers and the sellers from the Temple of Jerusalem,
      as it is written in the Evangelists, Matthew and John. He applied the corruption that was there to the corruption that
      is in the Papistry; and Christ's act, to the duty of those to whom God giveth power and zeal thereto. The result was
      that the magistrates within the town, the provost and<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_162">162</span> bailies, as well
      as the community for the most part, agreed to remove all monuments of idolatry, and this they did with expedition.

      said. The hot fury of the Archbishop did so kindle her choler (and yet the love was very cold betwixt them) that, without
      any further delay, it was decided to invade St. Andrews.... When this was known, counsel was given to the Lords to
      march forward and get to Cupar before the Queen. This they did, giving notice to all brethren to repair towards them
      with possible expedition. This also was done with such diligence that in their assembling the wondrous work of God
      might have been espied. When the Lords came to Cupar at night, they were not a hundred horse, and a certain number
      of footmen, whom Lord James brought from the coast side; and yet, before the next day at twelve o'clock, which was
      Tuesday, the thirteenth of June, their number exceeded three thousand men.... Finally, God did so multiply our number
      that it appeared as if men had rained from the clouds. The enemy, understanding nothing of our force, assured themselves
      of victory.... Before midnight they sent forward their ordnance, themselves following before three o'clock in the morning.

<p id="iii.ii-p70" shownumber="no">The Lords, being notified of this, assembled their company upon Cupar Moor early in the morning.... The Lord Ruthven took
      charge of the horsemen, and so ordered them that the enemy was never permitted to espy our number; the day was dark,
      and that helped. The enemy, thinking to have found no resistance, after they had twice or thrice made a feint of retiring,
      advanced with great expedition, and approached within a mile before ever their horsemen stayed.... After twelve o'clock,
      the mist began to vanish, and then some of their horsemen occupied an eminence whence they might discern our number.
      When they perceived this, their horsemen and footmen came to a speedy halt. Posts ran to the Duke and Monsieur D'Oysel
      to
      <span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_163">163</span> declare our number, and what order we kept; and then were mediators
      sent to make appointment. They were not suffered to approach the Lords, nor yet to view our camp. This put them in
      greater fear.... Answer received, the Duke and Monsieur D'Oysel, having commission from the Queen Regent, required
      that assurance<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.ii-p70.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.ii-p70.1">136</a></sup><span class="mnote"

      eight days, to the end that indifferent men in the meantime might commune upon some final agreement concerning those

<p id="iii.ii-p71" shownumber="no">The assurance granted by the Earl of Arran and others contained faithful promise, "that we, and our company foresaid, shall

      had been promised to be sent from the Queen, for the preparation of an appointment. Perceiving her craft and deceit
      (for under that assurance she meant nothing else than to convey herself, her ordnance, and Frenchmen, over the water
      of Forth) we took consultation as to what should be done to deliver Perth from these ungodly<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_164">164</span>      soldiers, and how our brethren, exiled from their own houses, might be restored again. It was decided that the brethren
      of Fife, Angus, Mearns, and Strathearn should convene at Perth on the twenty-fourth day of June for that purpose; and

      proudly that they would keep and defend that town, according to promise made to the Queen Regent.... And so, upon Saturday,
      the twenty-fourth of June, at ten o'clock at night, the Lord Ruthven, who besieged the west quarter, commanded to shoot
      the first volley. This being done, the town of Dundee, whose ordnance lay upon the east side of the bridge, did the
      like. The captains and soldiers within the town, perceiving that they were unable long to resist, requested a truce
      until twelve o'clock noon, promising that, if before that hour there came no relief to them from the Queen Regent,
      they would surrender the town, provided that they should be suffered to depart from the town with ensigns displayed.
      We, thirsting for the blood of no man, and seeking only the liberty of our brethren, suffered them freely to depart
      without any further molestation....

<p id="iii.ii-p74" shownumber="no">The Bishop of Moray lay in the Abbey of Scone, and it was thought good that some proceedings should be taken against him
      and against that place, which lay near to the town-end. The Lords wrote unto him, for he lay within two miles of Perth,
      that, unless he would come and assist them, they neither could spare nor save his place. He answered, by writing, that
      he would come, and would do as they thought expedient; that he would assist them with his force, and would vote with

      diligence, laboured to save the Palace and Kirk. But, the multitude having found a great number of idols buried in
      the Kirk for the purpose of preserving them to a better day (as the Papists speak), the towns of Dundee and Perth could
      not be satisfied, until the whole furnishings and ornaments of the Church were destroyed. Yet did the Lords so travail
      that they saved the Bishop's Palace, with the Church and place for that night; for the two Lords did not depart until
      they brought with them the whole number of those that most sought the Bishop's displeasure.... The Bishop's girnell

      affirmed, one of the Bishop's sons stogged through with a rapier a man of Dundee, for looking in at the girnell door....

      that purpose not only lay himself in one of the monasteries every night, but also constrained the most honest of the
      town, to their great grief and trouble, to keep vigil for the safety of those monsters. Hearing of our sudden coming,
      however, he had abandoned his charge, and had left the spoil to the poor, who had made havoc of all such things as
      were movable in those places before our coming, and had left nothing but bare walls, yea, not so much as door or window.

We gave commission and power to them to expose our
      whole purpose and intent, which was none other than before at all times we had insisted upon, to wit, that we might
      enjoy the liberty of conscience; that Christ Jesus might be truly preached, and His holy Sacraments rightly ministered
      unto us; that unable ministers might be removed from ecclesiastical administration; that our preachers might be relaxed
      from the horn, and permitted to perform their duties without molestation, until such time as, either by a General Council,
      lawfully convened, or by a Parliament within the realm, the controversies in religion were decided; and that the bands
      of Frenchmen,<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_167">167</span> who were an intolerable burden to the country, and so
      fearful to us that we durst not in peaceable and quiet manner haunt the places where they did lie, should be sent to
      France, their native country. These things granted, her Grace should have experience of our customary obedience.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p81" shownumber="no">To these heads the Queen did answer at the first pleasantly, but then she began to handle the matter more craftily, complaining
      that she was not sought in a gentle manner; and that they in whom she had put most singular confidence had left her
      in her greatest need. In discussing these and such other things, pertaining nothing to their commission, she sought
      to spend and drive the time.... In the end of this communing, on the twelfth day of July 1559, she desired to have
      private talk with the Earl of Argyll, and Lord James, Prior of St. Andrews.... The Council, after consultation, thought
      it inexpedient that the Earl and Prior should talk with the Queen in any way; for her former practices made all men
      suspect that some deceit lurked under such coloured communing. It was known that she had said that, if she could by
      any means sunder those two from the rest, she was sure she should shortly attain her whole purpose; and one of her
      chief counsellors in those days had said that before Michaelmas day these two should lose their heads.... The Queen,
      perceiving that her craft could not prevail, was content that the Duke's Grace and the Earl of Huntly, with others
      appointed by her, should convene at Preston, to commune with the said Earl and Prior, and such others as the Lords
      of the Congregation would appoint. These, convening at Preston, spake the whole day without any certain conclusion.
      For this was the subterfuge of the Queen and of her faction. By drift of time she hoped to weary our company, who,
      for the most part, had been in the field from the tenth day of May, and that when we were dispersed she might come
      to her purpose. In this she was not altogether deceived; for our commons were compelled to skaill for lack of expenses,
      and our gentlemen, partly constrained by lack of furnishing and partly hoping that some<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_168">168</span>      small appointment would result from so many communings, returned for the most part to their dwelling places, to repose
      themselves.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p82" shownumber="no">The Queen, in all these conventions, seemed to indicate that she would give liberty to religion, provided that, wheresoever
      she was, our preachers should cease, and the Mass should be maintained. We, perceiving her malicious craft, answered
      that we would compel her Grace to no religion, but that we could not, of conscience, for the pleasure of any earthly
      creature, put silence to God's true messengers. Nor could we suffer that the right administration of Christ's true
      sacraments should give place to manifest idolatry; for in so doing we should declare ourselves enemies to God, to Christ
      Jesus His Son, to His eternal truth and to the liberty and establishment of His Church within this realm. If her request
      were granted, there could be no Kirk within the realm so established but that, at her pleasure, and by her residence
      and remaining there, she might overthrow the same....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p83" shownumber="no">To no point would the Queen answer directly; but in all things she was so general and so ambiguous, that her craft appeared
      to all men. She had gotten sure information that our company was skailled—for her Frenchmen were daily amongst us,
      without molestation or hurt done to them—and therefore she began to disclose her mind. "The Congregation," she said,
      "has reigned these two months bypast: me myself would reign now other two." The malice of her heart being plainly perceived,
      there was deliberation as to what was to be done. It was decided that the Lords, Barons and gentlemen, with their substantial
      households, should remain in Edinburgh that whole winter, for the purpose of establishing the Church there. When it
      was found that, by corrupting our money, the Queen made to herself immoderate gains for maintaining her soldiers, thereby
      destroying our whole commonwealth, it was thought necessary that the printing irons<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.ii-p83.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.ii-p83.1">140</a></sup>

      that the same God could not long suffer her obstinate malice against His truth to remain unpunished. But her indurate
      heart could not be moved to repentance; and, hearing of the detention of the printing irons, she raged more outrageously
      than before.... We answered that we, without usurpation of anything justly pertaining to the Crown of Scotland, had
      stayed the printing irons because the commonwealth was greatly hurt by the corrupting of our money....

<p id="iii.ii-p86" shownumber="no">Partly by her craft and policy, and partly by the labours of the Archbishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow, the Queen Regent
      procured, from the whole number that were with her, consent to pursue us with all cruelty and expedition, before we
      could again assemble our forces, then dispersed for new equipment. Certain knowledge of this reached us on the Saturday
      at night, on the twenty-second of July, and we did what in us lay to give notice to our brethren. It was impossible,
      however, that those of the West, Angus, Mearns, Strathearn, or Fife, in any number, could come to us; for the enemy
      marched from Dunbar upon the Sunday, and approached within two miles of us before sunrise upon Monday. They verily
      supposed that they should have found no resistance, being assured that only the Lords and certain gentlemen remained,
      with their private households.... The most part of the town appeared rather to favour us than the Queen's faction;
      and offered us the uttermost of their support, a promise that, for the most part, they faithfully kept. The town of
      Leith made similar promise, but they did not keep the like fidelity; for, when we were upon the field, advancing to
      their support, when the French were close upon them, they surrendered without further resistance. Their unprovided
      and sudden defection astonished many; and yet we retired quietly to the side of Craig-end gate, where we took up a
      defensive position.... Before eight o'clock in the morning, God had given<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_170">170</span>      us both courage and a reasonable number wherewith to withstand the fury of the enemy. As many of the town of Edinburgh
      as had been trained to arms, and divers others besides, behaved themselves both faithfully and stoutly. The gentlemen
      of Lothian, and especially Calder, Haltoun, and Ormiston, were very helpful....

      had determined to fight, he sent word to the Earl of Argyll, to Lord James, his sister's son, and to the other noblemen,
      that he would declare himself both enemy to them and to the town, and would shoot at both, if they made any resistance
      to the entrance of the Frenchmen to the town. We could not fight or stop the enemy, but under the mercy of the Castle
      and whole ordnance thereof. In conclusion, it was found less damage to take an appointment, albeit the conditions were
      not such as we desired, than to hazard battle betwixt two such enemies. After long talking, certain heads were drawn

      his faithful labours and bold courage in that battle, deserves immortal praise. When it was found dangerous for John
      Knox, already elected minister to that Kirk, to continue there, the brethren requested the said John Willock to abide
      with them, lest, for lack of ministers, idolatry should again be erected. To this he so gladly consented that it was
      evident that he preferred the comfort of his brethren and the continuance of the Kirk there to his own life. One part
      of the Frenchmen were appointed to lie in garrison at Leith (that was the first benefit they got for their confederacy
      with them), the other part were appointed to lie in the Canongate; the Queen and her train abiding in the Abbey. Our

      to stand constant in the truth which they had professed.

      Thereafter they began to require that Mass should be set up again in St. Giles's Kirk, and that the people should be
      set at liberty to choose what religion they would: for, they affirmed, it had been a condition in the Appointment that
      the town of Edinburgh should have what religion they cared for. To ascertain this, the Duke, the Earl of Huntly, and
      the Lord Seton were sent to the Tolbooth, to solicit all men to submit to the Queen's opinion. The two last named did
      what they could, but the Duke remained a mere beholder, and of him<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_172">172</span>      the brethren had good hopes. After many persuasions and threatenings by the said Earl and Lord, the brethren stoutly

      or at least be contented that Mass should be said either after or before their sermons. Answer was given that they
      could not give place to the Devil, who was the chief inventor of the Mass, for the pleasure of any creature. They were
      in possession of that kirk, and they could not abandon it; nor could they suffer idolatry to be set up there, unless
      they should be constrained so to do by violence, and, if this were resorted to, they were determined to seek the next
      remedy.... By God's grace, the citizens continued in faithful service of God until the month of November. They not
      only convened to the preaching, daily supplications, and administration of baptism; but also the Lord's Table was administered,
      even in the eyes of the very enemy, to the great comfort of many afflicted consciences.

      to be said, first in her own chapel, and after that in the Abbey, where the altars had before been cast down. Her malice
      extended in like manner to Cambuskenneth; for there she cancelled the stipends of as many of the Canons as had forsaken

      as she thought expedient. She accused the Duke of violating his promise; she made long protestation of her love towards

      being also but a Regent whose pretences threatened the bondage of the whole commonwealth, ought to be suffered so tyrannously
      to empire over them? Because this question had not before been disputed in open assembly, it was thought expedient
      that the judgment of the preachers should be required. These being called and instructed in the case, John Willock

</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p102" shownumber="no">"First. That, albeit magistrates be God's ordinance, having power and authority from Him, their power is not so largely extended,

      and, finally, she had utterly despised the counsel and requests of the nobility. Upon these grounds he argued that

      James, the Master of Maxwell, with the most part of the horsemen, took sudden purpose to pursue the said Earl of Bothwell,

</div>
<p id="iii.ii-p121" shownumber="no">The next Wednesday, which was the seventh of November, John Knox preached (John Willock having departed to England, as he
      had previously arranged) and treated of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth versicles of the Fourscore Psalm....
      In his exposition he declared the reasons for which God sometimes suffered His chosen flock to be exposed to mockage,
      to dangers, and to apparent destruction: to wit, that they might feel the vehemency of God's indignation; that they
      might know how little strength was in themselves; that they might leave a testimony to the generations following, as
      well of the malice of the Devil against God's people, as of the marvellous work of God in preserving His little flock
      by far other means than man can espy. In explaining these words, "How long shalt Thou be angry, O Lord, against the
      prayer of Thy people?" he declared how dolorous and fearful it was to fight against the temptation to believe that
      God turned away His face from our prayers, for that was nothing else than to comprehend and conceive God to be armed
      for our destruction. This temptation no flesh could abide or overcome, unless the mighty Spirit of God interponed Himself
      suddenly.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p122" shownumber="no">By way of example, he noted the impatience of Saul, when God would not hear his prayers. He plainly declared that the difference
      between the elect and reprobate in that temptation was that the elect, sustained by the secret power of God's Spirit,
      did still call upon God, albeit He appeared to contemn their prayers. That, he said, was the sacrifice most acceptable
      to God, and was in a manner even to fight with<span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_182">182</span> God, and to overcome
      Him, as Jacob did in warselling with His Angel. But the reprobate, said he, being denied of their requests at God's
      hand, either ceased to pray, and altogether contemned God, albeit He had straitly commanded us to call upon Him in
      the day of adversity; or else they sought from the Devil that which they saw they could not obtain from God.
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p123" shownumber="no">In the second part, he declared how hard it was to this corrupt nature of ours not to rejoice and put confidence in itself
      when God gave victory; and, therefore, how necessary it was that man by affliction should be brought to the knowledge
      of his own infirmity, lest, puffed up with vain confidence, he should make an idol of his own strength, as did King
      Nebuchadnezzar. He gravely disputed upon the nature of the blind world, which, in all ages, had insolently rejoiced
      when God did chasten His own children. The reprobate could never see their glory and honour, and therefore despised
      them, and the wondrous work of God in them. "And yet," said he, "the joy and rejoicing of the world is but mere sorrow,
      because the end of it tendeth to sudden destruction, as the riotous banqueting of Belshazzar declareth.... I doubt
      not that some of us have oftener than once read this Psalm, as also that we have read and heard the travail and troubles
      of our ancient fathers. But which of us, either in reading or hearing their dolours and temptations, did so descend
      into ourselves that we felt the bitterness of their passions? I think none. And therefore has God brought us to some
      experience in our own persons....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p124" shownumber="no">"When we were few in number, in comparison with our enemies, when we had neither Earl nor Lord, a few excepted, to comfort
      us, we called upon God; we took Him for our protector, defence, and only refuge. Amongst us, we heard no bragging of
      multitude, of our strength, nor policy: we did only sob to God, to have respect to the equity of our cause, and to
      the cruel pursuit of the tyrannous enemy. But since our number hath been thus multiplied, and chiefly since my Lord
      Duke's Grace and his friends have been joined with us, there has been nothing heard, but, 'This Lord will bring
      <span class="pb" id="iii.ii-Page_183">183</span> these many hundred spears:' 'this man hath the credit to persuade

      potent hand to be our defence, have of late days put flesh to be our arm....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p125" shownumber="no">"I am uncertain if my Lord's Grace hath unfeignedly repented of his assistance to these murderers unjustly pursuing us. Yea,
      I am uncertain if he hath repented of that innocent blood of Christ's blessed martyrs which was shed in his default.
      But let it be that so he hath done (as I hear that he hath confessed his offence before the Lords and Brethren of the
      Congregation), I am yet assured that neither he nor his friends have felt before this time the anguish and grief of
      heart suffered by us when in their blind fury they pursued us. Therefore hath God justly permitted both them and us
      to fall into this confusion at the same time: us, because we put our trust and confidence in man; and them, that they
      should feel in their own hearts how bitter was the cup which they made others drink. It only remains that both they
      and we should turn to the Eternal our God, who beats down to death, to the intent that He may raise up again, and leave
      the remembrance of His wondrous deliverance, to the praise of His own name....
</p>
<p id="iii.ii-p126" shownumber="no">"Yea, whatever shall become of us and of our mortal carcases, I doubt not but that this cause, in despite of Satan, shall
      prevail in the realm of Scotland. For, as it is the eternal truth of the eternal God, so shall it once prevail, howsoever
      for a time it be impugned. It may be that God shall plague some because they delight not in the truth, albeit for worldly
      respects they seem to favour it. Yea, God may take some of His dearest children away before their eyes see greater
      troubles. But neither shall the one nor the other hinder this action, and in the end it shall triumph."

      and brought certain Articles to be answered by us. Thereupon the Nobility convened at Stirling, and returned answer
      with diligence. The French, informed of this, marched to Linlithgow, spoiled the Duke's house, and wasted his lands
      of Kinneil; thereafter coming to Stirling, where they remained for some days. The Duke, and the Earls of Argyll and
      Glencairn, with their friends, moved on to Glasgow, the Earl of Arran and Lord James, to St. Andrews; for charge had
      been given to all the Protestant Nobility to conserve their forces until God should send them further support.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p4.1">The French invade Fife.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p5" shownumber="no">The French laid their plans for assaulting Fife first; for it had stirred their great indignation. Their purpose was to have
      taken and fortified the town, the Abbey, and the Castle of St. Andrews. So they came to Culross, after that to Dunfermline,
      and then to Burntisland, where they began to fortify. But they soon had reason to desist and march to Kinghorn. For,
      when the Earl of Arran and the Lord James learned that the French had departed from Stirling, they departed also from
      St. Andrews, and began to assemble their forces at Cupar. They also sent their men of war to Kinghorn; and to them
      there resorted divers of the coast side, who were of mind to resist at the beginning, rather than when the French had
      destroyed a part of their towns. As the Lords had given express command that nothing should be hazarded until they
      themselves were present, the Lord Ruthven, a man of great experience, and inferior to few in stoutness, was dispatched
      to Kinghorn.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p5.1">An Affair at Pettycur.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p6" shownumber="no">The men of war, and the rascal multitude, perceiving Frenchmen landing from certain boats which had come from Leith, determined
      to stop their coming ashore. Not considering the enemies that approached from Burntisland, they unadvisedly rushed
      down to the Pettycur, as the brae be-west Kinghorn is called, and at the sea-coast<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_187">187</span>      began skirmishing. They never took heed to the enemy that approached by land, until the horsemen charged down upon
      their backs, and the whole bands met them in the face. They were thus compelled to give back, with the loss of six
      or seven men killed, and some others taken prisoner. The reason why there was so small a loss in so great a danger
      was, next to the merciful providence of God, the sudden coming of the Lord Ruthven. Immediately after our men had given
      back, he and his company came to the head of the brae, and stayed the French footmen, while some of ours broke upon
      their horsemen, and so repulsed them that they did no further hurt to our footmen.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p6.1">The French occupy Kinghorn.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p7" shownumber="no">The French took Kinghorn, and there they lay, wasting the country about, as well Papists as Protestants, yea, even those
      that were confederate with them, such as Seafield, Wemyss, Balmuto, Balweary, and others, enemies to God and traitors
      to their country. They spared not the sheep, the oxen, the kine, and horse of these men, and some say that their wives
      and daughters got favours of the French soldiers. Thus did God recompense the Papists in their own bosoms, for, besides
      the defiling of their houses, two of them received more damage than did all the gentlemen that professed the Evangel
      within Fife, the Laird of Grange only excepted. His house of the Grange the French overthrew by gunpowder.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p8" shownumber="no">The Queen Regent, proud of this victory, burst forth in blasphemous railing, and said, "Where is now John Knox's God? My
      God is now stronger than his, yea, even in Fife." To her friends in France she posted news that thousands of the heretics
      had been slain, and that the rest were fled; and required that some nobleman would come and take the glory of that
      victory. Upon that information, the Count de Martigues, with two ships, and some captains and horse, were directed
      to come to Scotland; but little to their own advantage, as we shall hear.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p8.1">John Knox preaches at Cupar.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p9" shownumber="no">The Lords of the Congregation, offended at the foolishness of the rascal multitude, recalled the men of war, and remained
      certain days at Cupar. To them repaired John Knox, and, in our greatest desperation, preached a most comfortable sermon.
      His subject was, "The danger in<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_188">188</span> which the disciples of Christ Jesus
      stood when they were in the midst of the sea, and Jesus was upon the mountain." He exhorted us not to faint, but still
      to row against these contrary blasts, until Jesus Christ should come; "for," said he, "I am as assuredly persuaded
      that God shall deliver us from the extreme trouble, as I am assured that this is the Evangel of Jesus Christ which
      I preach unto you this day. I am assured, albeit I cannot assure you, by reason of this present rage; God grant that
      ye may acknowledge His hand, after your eyes have seen His deliverance." In that sermon he comforted many. And yet
      he offended the Earl of Arran, who apprehended that certain words were spoken in reproach of him, because he kept himself
      more close and solitary than many men would have wished.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p9.1">The Campaign in Fife.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p10" shownumber="no">After these things, determination was taken that the Earl of Arran and Lord James, with the men of war and some company of
      horsemen, should go to Dysart, and there lie in wait upon the French, so that they should not utterly destroy the sea-coast,
      as they had intended to have done. The said Earl and Lord James did as they were appointed, albeit their company was
      very small; and yet they did so valiantly, that it passed all credibility. For twenty-one days they lay in their clothes;
      their boots never came off: they had skirmishing almost every day; yea, some days, from morn to even. The French had
      four thousand soldiers, beside their favourers and faction of the country. The Lords had never altogether five hundred
      horsemen, with a hundred soldiers; and yet they held the French so busy, that for every horse they slew to the Congregation,
      they lost four French soldiers.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p11" shownumber="no">William Kirkaldy of Grange, on the day after his house was cast down, sent in his defiance to Monsieur D'Oysel and the rest,
      declaring that to that hour had he used the French favourably. He had saved their lives, when he might have suffered
      their throats to be cut; but, seeing that they had used him with that rigour, let them not look for that favour in
      times to come. The said William Kirkaldy, and the Master of Lyndsay, escaped many dangers. The Master had his horse
      slain under him: the said William was almost betrayed in his<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_189">189</span> house
      at Hallyards. Yet they never ceased; night and day they waited upon the French.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p12" shownumber="no">On one occasion, they with some gentlemen laid themselves in a secret place, before day, to await the French, who were wont
      to ish in companies, to seek their prey. Forth came a Captain Battu, with his hundred men, and began to spoil. The
      said Master, now Lord of Lyndsay, and the said William, suffered this without showing themselves or their company,
      until they had them more than a mile from Kinghorn. Then the horsemen began to break. Perceiving this, the French drew
      together to a place called Glennis House, and made for debate; some took the house, and others defended the close and
      yard. The hazard appeared very unlikely, for our men had nothing but spears, and were compelled to light upon their
      feet. The others were within dykes; and all had culverins: the shot was fearful to many, and divers were hurt. Kirkaldy,
      perceiving men to faint and begin to recoil, cried, "Fie, let us never live after this day, if we shall recoil for
      French schybalds<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iii-p12.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iii-p12.1">152</a></sup>
      <span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.iii-p12.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.iii-p12.1">152</a></sup>Mean fellows.</span>;"
      and so the Master of Lyndsay and he burst in at the yett, and others followed. The Master struck with his spear at
      La Battu, and glancing upon his harness, for fierceness stammered<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iii-p12.2"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iii-p12.2">153</a></sup>

      he would not be taken, was slain, and fifty of his company with him. Those that were in the house, with some others,
      were saved, and sent to Dundee to be kept. This mischance to the Frenchmen made them more circumspect in scattering
      abroad in the country; and so the poor folk got some relief.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p13" shownumber="no">To furnish the French with victuals, Captain Cullen, with two ships, travelled betwixt the south shore and Kinghorn. For
      his wages, he spoiled Kinghorn, Kirkcaldy, and as much of Dysart as he might. For remedy, two ships were sent from
      Dundee, Andrew Sands, a stout and fervent man in the cause of religion, being in command. At the same time Count de
      Martigues arrived. Without delay he landed himself, his coffers, and the principal gentlemen that were with him at
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_190">190</span> Leith, leaving the rest in his two ships until more convenient opportunity.
      But the said Andrew, and his companion, striking sail and making as if they would cast anchor hard beside them, boarded
      them both, and carried them to Dundee. In them were gotten some horse and much harness, with some other trifles; but
      of money we heard not.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p13.1">An English Fleet arrives in the Forth.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p14" shownumber="no">The French were incensed, and vowed the destruction of St. Andrews and Dundee. Upon Monday morning, the twenty-third day
      of January 1560, they marched from Dysart, and crossed the water of Leven; ever keeping the sea-coast, for the sake
      of their ships and victuals. About twelve o'clock they espied ships. These had been seen that morning by us that were
      upon the land, but they were not known. Monsieur D'Oysel affirmed them to be French ships, and so the soldiers triumphed,
      shot their volley for salutation, and marched forward to Kincraig, fearing no resistance. But shortly after, the English
      ships, meeting with Captain Cullen, seized him and his ships, and this made them muse a little.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p15" shownumber="no">Suddenly came Master Alexander Wood, and assured Monsieur D'Oysel, that they were Englishmen, and that they were the fore-riders
      of a greater number that followed for the support of the Congregation. Then might have been seen the riving of beards,
      and might have been heard such despite as cruel men are wont to spue forth when God bridleth their fury. Weariness
      and the night constrained them to lodge where they were. They supped scarcely, because their ships were taken. In these
      were their victuals, and also the ordnance which they intended to have placed in St. Andrews. They themselves durst
      not stray abroad to forage; and the Laird of Wemyss's carriage, which likewise was coming with provisions for them,
      was stayed. Betimes in the morning, they retired towards Kinghorn, and made more expedition in one day in retiring,
      than they had done in two in advancing.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p15.1">The French retire on Edinburgh.

<p id="iii.iii-p16" shownumber="no">The storm, which had continued for the space of nearly a month, broke at the very time of the retreat of the French. Many
      thought they would have been stayed by this until a reasonable company might have been assembled to have fought them;
      and with that purpose William<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_191">191</span> Kirkaldy cut the bridge of Tullibody.
      But the French, expert enough in such work, took down the roof of a parish kirk, and made a bridge over the water called
      the Devon. So they escaped, and came to Stirling, and syne to Leith.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p16.1">A greedy Frenchman dies in a Beef-tub.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p17" shownumber="no">In their retreat, the French spoiled the country and lost divers men; amongst whom there was one whose miserable end we must
      rehearse. A Frenchman—captain or soldier, we cannot tell, but he had a red cloak and a gilt morion—entered upon a poor
      woman, that dwelt in the Whyteside, and began to spoil. The poor woman offered him such bread as she had ready prepared.
      But he, in no ways content therewith, demanded the meal and a little salt beef with which she had to sustain her own
      life, and the lives of her poor children. Neither could tears nor pitiful words mitigate the merciless man; he would
      have whatsoever he could carry. The poor woman perceiving him so bent, and that he stooped down into her tub to take
      forth such stuff as was within it, cowped up his heels, so that his head went down; and there he ended his unhappy
      life.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p17.2">The Negotiations between the Congregation and the English Court.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p18" shownumber="no">From this time forward, frequent mention will be made of the comfortable support that we, by God's providence, received in
      our greatest extremity from our neighbours of England. We therefore think it expedient simply to declare how that matter
      was first moved, and by what means it came to pass that the Queen and Council of England showed themselves so favourable
      to us.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p19" shownumber="no">John Knox had forewarned us, by his letters from Geneva, of all dangers that he foresaw to ensue from our enterprise; and,
      when he came to Dieppe, mindful of these, and revolving with himself what remedy God would please to offer, he had
      the boldness to write to Sir William Cecil, Secretary of England. With him the said John had formerly been familiarly
      acquainted, and he intended thereby to renew acquaintance, and so to open his mind further....
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p20" shownumber="no">To this letter no answer was made; for, shortly thereafter, the said John made forward to Scotland by sea, where he
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_192">192</span> landed on the third day of May; and had such success as has been
      declared in the Second Book. The said John, being in St. Andrews after Cupar Moor, entered into deep discourse with
      the Laird of Grange: the dangers were evident, but the support was not easy to be seen. After many words, John Knox
      burst forth as follows: "If England would foresee their own commodity, yea, if they did consider the danger wherein
      they themselves stand, they would not suffer us to perish in this quarrel; for France hath decreed no less the conquest
      of England than of Scotland." After long reasoning, it was concluded betwixt them two that support should be craved
      of England. For that purpose, the said Laird of Grange first wrote to Sir Harry Percy, and afterwards rode from Edinburgh
      and spake with him. To him he made so plain demonstration of the apparent danger to England, that he took upon him
      to write to the Secretary Cecil; who with expedition returned answer back again. Sir Harry was given to understand
      that our enterprise was not altogether misliked by the Council, albeit they desired further resolution on the part
      of the principal Lords. When this was understood, it was concluded by some to write unto him plainly our whole purpose....
      With this our letter, John Knox wrote two, one to the Secretary, and another to the Queen's Majesty herself.... These
      letters were directed by Alexander Whitelaw, a man that hath oft hazarded himself, and his all, for the cause of God,
      and for his friends when in danger for the same cause.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p21" shownumber="no">Within a day or two after the departure of the said Alexander, there came a letter from Sir Harry Percy to John Knox, requiring
      him to meet him at Alnwick, on the third of August, upon such affairs as he would not write of, nor yet communicate
      to any but the said John himself. While he was preparing himself for the journey, for Secretary Cecil had appointed
      to meet him at Stamford, the Frenchmen came forth furiously from Dunbar, intending to have surprised the Lords in Edinburgh,
      as in the Second Book has been declared. This stayed the journey of the said John, until God had delivered the innocent
      from that great danger; and then was he (having Master Robert Hamilton, minister of the Evangel of Jesus<span class="pb"
            id="iii.iii-Page_193">193</span> Christ, in his company) directed from the Lords, with full commission and instructions
      to set forth their whole cause and estate.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p22" shownumber="no">The passage was from Pittenweem, by sea. Arriving at Holy Island, and being informed that Sir Harry Percy was absent from
      the North, they addressed themselves to Sir James Crofts, then Captain of Berwick and Warden of the East Marches of
      England. They showed to him their credit and commission. He received them gently, and comforted them with his faithful
      counsel, which was that they should travel no farther, nor yet should they be seen in public, and that for divers considerations.
      First, the Queen Regent had her spies in England. Secondarily, the Queen and the Council favoured our action, but would
      that all things should remain secret as long as possible. And last, said he, "I do not think it expedient that, when
      preachers are so scarce, ye two should be any long time absent from the Lords. Therefore," said he, "ye shall do best
      to commit to writing your whole mind and credit, and I shall promise to you, upon my honour, to have answer delivered
      to you and the Lords, before ye yourselves could reach London. And where your letters cannot express all things so
      fully as your presence could, I, not only by my pen, but also by my own presence, shall supply the same, to such as
      will inform the Council sufficiently of all things."
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p23" shownumber="no">The said John and Master Robert followed this counsel, for it was faithful and proceeded of love at that time. They tarried
      with Sir James Crofts very secretly, within the Castle of Berwick, for two days, when Alexander Whitelaw returned with
      answer to the Lords, and to John Knox, the tenor of whose letter was this:—

      a sum of money as served all the public affairs until the next November; John Cockburn of Ormiston was then sent for
      the second support, and receiving the same, unhappily fell into the hands of the Earl Bothwell, and was wounded, taken,
      and spoiled of a great sum. Upon this mischance followed all the rest of our troubles before rehearsed....
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p32" shownumber="no">In the negotiation of the Secretary Lethington with the Queen and Council of England, in which he travailed with no less
      wisdom and faithfulness than happy success, many things occurred that required the resolution of the whole Lords. Amongst
      these there was one of which we have made no previous mention.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p33" shownumber="no">After the Queen and Council of England had concluded to send their army into Scotland to expel the French, the Duke of Norfolk
      was sent to Berwick, with full instructions, power, and commission, to do in all things, concerning the present affairs
      of Scotland, as the Queen and Councillors in their own persons might do. Hereupon, the said Duke required such a part
      of the Lords of Scotland as had power and commission from the whole to meet him at such day and place as it might please
      them to appoint. The intimation came first to Glasgow, by means of the Master of Maxwell. When this had been read and
      considered by the Lords, it was agreed that they should meet at Carlisle. This arrangement was made on the procurement
      of the said Master of Maxwell, for his own ease.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p33.1">John Knox reproaches the Lords for Slackness and Thoughtlessness.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p34" shownumber="no">Letters were directed from the Lords, lying at Glasgow, to Lord James, requiring him to repair towards them for the purpose
      named, with all possible expedition. When these letters had been read and advised upon, commandment was given to John
      Knox to make the answer.... And he wrote as follows:—"I have written oftener than once to Mr. Henry Balnaves concerning
      things that have misliked me in your<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_197">197</span> slow proceedings in supporting
      your brethren, who many days have sustained extreme danger in these parts, as well as in making provision how the enemy
      might have been annoyed, when they lay in few numbers nigh to your quarters in Stirling; and in making provision how
      the expectation of your friends, who long have awaited for your answer, might have been satisfied. But although I have
      complained of those things, of very conscience, I am yet compelled to signify unto your honours that, unless I shall
      espy some redress of these and other enormities, I am assured that the end shall be such as godly men shall mourn,
      and that a good cause shall perish for lack of wisdom and diligence.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p35" shownumber="no">"In my last letters to Mr. Henry Balnaves, I declared that your especial friends in England wonder that no greater expedition
      is made, the weight of the matter being considered. I wrote also that, if the fault were with the Lord Duke and his
      friends, the greatest loss should be his and theirs in the end. And now, I cannot cease both to wonder and lament that
      your whole Council was so destitute of wisdom and discretion as to charge this poor man, the Prior, to come to you
      to Glasgow, and thereafter to go to Carlisle, for such affairs as are to be entreated. Was there none amongst you who
      did foresee what inconveniences might ensue his absence from these parts?
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p36" shownumber="no">"I cease to speak of the dangers from the enemy. Your friends have lain in the Firth now for fifteen days bypast, and what
      was their former travail is not unknown; yet they have never received comfort from any man, him only excepted, more
      than if they had lain upon the coast of their mortal enemy. Do ye not consider that such a company needs comfort and
      provision from time to time? Remove him, and who abideth that carefully will travail in that or any other weighty matter
      in these parts? Did ye not further consider that he had begun to meddle with the gentlemen who had declared themselves
      unfriends heretofore; and also that order would have been taken for such as have been neutral? Now, by reason of his
      absence, the former will escape without<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_198">198</span> admonition, and the latter
      will retain their former liberty. I am assured that the enemy will not sleep, either in that or in other affairs. They
      will undermine you and your whole cause; and, especially, they will hurt this part of the country in revenge for their
      former folly.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p37" shownumber="no">"If none of these causes should have moved you to have considered that such a journey, at such a time, was not meet for the
      Lord James, or for them that must accompany him, discreet men would yet have considered that the men that have lien
      in their jacks, and travailed their horses continually the space of a month, require some longer rest than yet they
      have had, both for themselves and, especially, for their horses, before they should have been charged to take such
      a journey. The Prior may, for satisfaction of your unreasonable minds, make the enterprise; but I am assured that he
      shall not be able to procure in all Fife six honest men to accompany him. How that stands either with your honour or
      his safety, judge ye yourselves.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p38" shownumber="no">"Again, it is a wonder that ye did not consider to what pain and fashery<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iii-p38.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iii-p38.1">158</a></sup>

      or else had too much respect to his own ease, and too small regard to the travail and danger of his brethren. A common
      cause requireth a common concurrence, and that every man bear his burden proportionably. Prudent and indifferent men
      espy the contrary in this cause, especially of late days; for the weakest are most grievously charged, and those to
      whom the matter most belongeth, and to whom justly the greatest burden is due, are in a manner exempted both from travail
      and expenses.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p39" shownumber="no">"To speak the matter plainly, wise men do wonder what my Lord Duke's friends do mean; they are so slack and backward in this
      cause. In other actions, they have been judged stout and forward; and in this, which is the greatest that ever he or
      they had in hand, they appear destitute both of grace<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_199">199</span> and of courage.
      I am not ignorant that they that are most inward in his counsels are enemies to God, and therefore cannot but be enemies
      to His cause. But the wonder is that he and his other friends do not consider that the tinsel of this godly enterprise
      will mean the rooting of them and their posterity from this realm. Considering, my Lords, that by God's providence
      ye are joined with the Duke's Grace in this common cause, do ye admonish him plainly of the danger to come. Will him
      to beware of the counsel of those that are plainly infected with superstition, with pride, and with venom of particular
      profits. If he do not this at your admonition, he shall smart, before he be aware; if ye cease to put him in mind of
      his duty, it may be that, for your silence, ye shall drink some portion of the plague with him...."

      Balgonie, and Durie, and others that had assisted the French. They were, however, soon set at freedom, upon conditions
      that they never intended to keep: for such men have neither faith nor honesty. Mr. James Balfour, who was the greatest
      practiser, escaped. The English ships multiplied daily, until they were able to keep the whole Firth. This enraged
      the French and the Queen Regent, and they began to execute their tyranny upon the parts of Lothian that lay near to

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p44.1">The principal Clauses of the Treaty of Berwick.

<p id="iii.iii-p45" shownumber="no">"... The Queen's Majesty, having sufficiently understood, as well by information sent from the nobility of Scotland, as by
      the manifest proceedings of the French, that they intend to conquer the realm of Scotland, suppress the liberties thereof,
      and unite the same unto the Crown of France perpetually, contrary to the laws of the same realm, and to the pacts,
      oaths, and promises of France; and being thereto most humbly and earnestly required by the said nobility, for and in
      name of the whole realm, shall accept the said realm of Scotland, the Duke of Chatelherault, Earl of Arran, being declared
      by Act of Parliament in Scotland to be heir-apparent to the Crown thereof, and the nobility and subjects thereof, unto
      Her Majesty's protection and maintenance, only for preservation of the same in their freedoms and liberties, and from
      conquest

      of Scots and the French King, and a year after. And, for expelling out of the same realm such as presently and apparently
      go about to practise the said conquest, Her Majesty shall with all speed send unto Scotland a convenient aid of men
      of war, on horse and foot, to join with the power<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iii-p45.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iii-p45.1">160</a></sup>

      land, not only to expel the present power of French within that realm, oppressing the same, but also to stop, as far
      as conveniently may be, all greater forces of French from entering therein for the like purpose. Her Majesty shall
      continue her aid to the said realm, nobility, and subjects of the same, unto the time that the French, being enemies
      to the said realm, are utterly expelled thence. Her Majesty shall never transact, compone, nor agree with the French,
      nor conclude any league with them, unless the Scots and the French shall be agreed; that the realm of Scotland may
      be left in due freedom by the French. Nor shall Her Majesty leave off the maintenance of the said nobility and subjects,
      whereby they might fall as a prey into their enemies' hands, as long as they shall acknowledge their Sovereign Lady

      strengths within the realm be won out of the hands of the French at this present time, or at any time hereafter, by
      Her Majesty's aid, the same shall be immediately demolished by the said Scotsmen, or delivered to the said Duke and
      his party foresaid, at their option and choice. Nor shall the power of England fortify within the ground of Scotland,

      to all such Scotsmen and French as shall in anywise show themselves enemies to the realm of England in respect of the
      aiding and supporting of the said Duke and nobility in the delivery of the realm of Scotland from conquest. They shall
      never assent nor permit that the realm of Scotland shall be conquered, or otherwise knit to the Crown of France than
      it is at this present time only by the marriage of the Queen their Sovereign to the French King, and by the laws and

      thereunto moved only upon respect of princely honour and neighbourhood for the defence of the freedom of Scotland from
      conquest, and not of any other sinister intent, do by these presents testify and declare that neither they nor any
      of them mean by this count to withdraw any due obedience to their Sovereign Lady the Queen, or to withstand the French
      King, her husband and head, in any lawful thing that, during the marriage, shall not tend to the subversion and oppression
      of the just and ancient liberties of the said kingdom of Scotland; for preservation whereof, both for their Sovereign's
      honour, and for the continuance of the kingdom in ancient estate, they acknowledge themselves bound to spend their
      goods, lands, and lives...."

      to Newcastle. Then the English began to assemble near the Border; and the French and Queen Regent, informed of this,
      began to destroy what they<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_203">203</span> could in the towns and country about. The
      whole victuals they carried to Leith; the mills they broke; the sheep, oxen, and kine, yea, the horses of poor labourers,
      they made all to serve their tyranny. In the end, they left nothing undone which very enemies could have devised, except
      that they demolished not gentlemen's houses, and burnt not the town of Edinburgh: in this particular, God bridled their
      fury, to let His afflicted understand that He took care of them.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p49" shownumber="no">Before the coming of the land army, the French passed to Glasgow, and destroyed the country thereabout. The tyranny used
      by the Marquis upon a poor Scottish soldier is fearful to hear, and yet his act may not be omitted. They would give
      no silver to the poor men, and so they were slow to depart from the town; and, albeit the drum was beaten, the ensign
      could not be got. A poor craftsman, who had bought for his victuals a grey loaf and was eating a morsel of it, was
      putting the rest of it in his bosom. The tyrant came to him, and with the poor caitiff's own whinger first struck him
      in the breast, and afterwards cast it at him. The poor man staggering and falling, the merciless tyrant ran him through
      with his rapier, and thereafter commanded him to be hung over the stair. Lord, Thou wilt yet look, and recompense such
      tyranny; however contemptible the person was!

<p id="iii.iii-p50" shownumber="no">On the second of April, in the year of God 1560, the army by land entered Scotland. Its conduct was committed to the Lord
      Grey, who had in his company the Lord Scrope, Sir James Crofts, Sir Harry Percy, and Sir Francis Lake; many other captains
      and gentlemen having charge, some of footmen, some of horsemen. The army by land was estimated at ten thousand men.
      The Queen Regent and some others of her faction had passed to the Castle of Edinburgh. At Preston the English were
      met by the Duke's Grace, the Earl of Argyll (Huntly came not until the siege was confirmed), Lord James, the Earls
      of Glencairn and Monteith, Lords Ruthven, Boyd, and Ochiltree, and all the Protestant gentlemen of West Fife, Angus,
      and Mearns. For a few days the army was great.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p51.1">The Siege of Leith: April 1560.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p52" shownumber="no">After two days' deliberation at Inveresk, the whole camp marched forward with ordnance and all preparation necessary for
      the siege, and came to Restalrig upon Palm Sunday evening. The French had put themselves in battle array upon the Links
      without Leith, and had sent forth their skirmishers. These, beginning before ten o'clock, continued skirmishing until
      after four o'clock in the afternoon, when some horsemen of Scotland and some of England charged upon them. But, because
      the principal captain of the horsemen of England was not present, the whole troop durst not charge, and so the overthrow
      and slaughter of the French was not so great as at one time it appeared to be. The great battle was once at the trot;
      but when the French perceived that the great force of the horsemen stood still, and charged not, they returned and
      gave some resource to their fellows that fled. Thus there fell in that defeat only about three hundred Frenchmen. God
      would not give the victory so suddenly, lest man should glory in his own strength. This small victory put both the
      English and Scots in too great security, as the issue declared.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p53" shownumber="no">The French enclosed within the town, the English army began to plant their pavilions betwixt Leith and Restalrig. The ordnance
      of the town, and especially that which lay upon St. Anthony's steeple, caused them great annoyance; and eight cannon
      were bent against this place. These shot so continually, and so accurately, that, within few days, that steeple was
      condemned, and all the ordnance on it was dismounted. This made the Englishmen somewhat more negligent than it became
      good men of war to have been; for, perceiving that the French made no pursuit outside their walls, they got the idea
      that they would never ish more. Some of the captains for pastime, went to the town:<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iii-p53.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iii-p53.1">164</a></sup>
      <span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.iii-p53.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.iii-p53.1">164</a></sup>That is, to Edinburgh.</span>      the soldiers, for their ease, laid their armour aside, and, as men beyond danger, fell to the dice and cards. So, upon
      Easter Monday, at the very hour of noon, when the French ished, both on horse and foot, and entered into the English
      trenches with great violence, they slew or put to flight all that were found there.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p54" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_205">205</span></p>
<p id="iii.iii-p55" shownumber="no">The watch was negligently kept, and succour was slow, and long in coming; the French, before any resistance was made, approached
      almost to the great ordnance. But then the horsemen trooped together, and the footmen got themselves in array, and
      so repulsed the French back again to the town. But the slaughter was great: some say it exceeded double of that which
      the French received the first day. And this was the fruit of their security and ours.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p56" shownumber="no">Matters were afterwards remedied; for the Englishmen, most wisely considering themselves not able to besiege the town at
      all points, made mounds at divers quarters of it. In these, they and their ordnance lay in as good strength as did
      the enemy within the town. The common soldiers kept the trenches, and had the said mounds for their safeguard and refuge,
      in case of any greater pursuit than they were able to sustain. The patience and stout courage of the Englishmen, but
      principally of the horsemen, is worthy of all praise: for where was it ever heard that eight thousand (they that lay
      in camp never exceeded that number) should besiege four thousand of the most desperate cut-throats that were to be
      found in Europe, and lie so near to them in daily skirmishing, for the space of three months and more. The horsemen
      kept watch night and day, and did so valiantly behave themselves that the French got no advantage from that day until
      the day of the assault.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p57" shownumber="no">In the meantime, another bond to defend the liberty of the Evangel of Christ was made by all the nobility, barons, and gentlemen,
      professing Christ Jesus in Scotland, and by divers others that joined with us in expelling the French army.... This
      contract and bond came not only to the ears but to the sight of the Queen Dowager. Thereat she stormed not a little,
      and said, "The malediction of God I give unto them that counselled me to persecute the preachers, and to refuse the
      petitions of the best part of the true subjects of this realm. It was said to me that the English army could not lie
      in Scotland ten days; but they have lain nearly a month now, and are more likely to remain than the first day they
      came."

<p id="iii.iii-p59" shownumber="no">They that gave such information to the Queen, spoke as worldly wise men, and as things appeared to have been. For, the country
      being almost in all parts wasted, the victuals within reach of Leith either brought in to their stores or else destroyed,
      and the mills and other places cast down, it appeared that the camp could not have been furnished, unless it had been
      by their own ships. That could not have been for any long continuance of time, and so would have been of little comfort.
      But God confounded all worldly wisdom, and made His own benediction as evidently to appear as if, in a manner, He had
      fed the army from above. In the camp all the time that it lay, after eight days had passed, all kinds of victuals were
      more abundant, and of more easy prices, than they had been in Edinburgh at any time in the two previous years, or yet
      have been in that town to this day. The people of Scotland so much abhorred the tyranny of the French that they would
      have given their substance to have been rid of that chargeable burden which our sins had provoked God to lay upon us—in
      giving us into the hands of a woman, whom our nobility, in their foolishness, sold unto strangers, and with her the
      liberty of the realm....

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p59.1">The Assault upon Leith is unsuccessful.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p60" shownumber="no">The camp abounding in all necessary provision, arrangements were made for the confirmation of the siege; and the trenches
      were drawn as near to the town as they well might be. The great camp removed from Restalrig to the west side of the
      Water of Leith; and the cannons were planted for the bombardment, and shot at the south-west wall. But all was earth,
      and the breach was not made so great during the day but that it was sufficiently repaired at night. The English, beginning
      to weary, determined to give the brush and assault. This they did, upon the seventh day of May, beginning before daylight,
      and continuing until it was near seven o'clock. Albeit the English and Scottish, with great slaughter of the soldiers
      of both, were repulsed, there was never a sharper assault given at the hands of so few. The men that assaulted the
      whole two quarters of the town exceeded not a thousand, and yet they silenced the whole block-houses; yea, they once
      put the<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_207">207</span> French clean off their walls, and were upon both the east
      and west block-houses. But they had not sufficient backing. Their ladders wanted six quarters of the proper height;
      and so, while the foremost were compelled to fight upon the top of the wall, their fellows could not get up to support
      them. Thus they were dung back again, by overwhelming numbers, when it was thought that the town was won.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p60.1">Sir James Crofts is blamed.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p61" shownumber="no">Sir James Crofts was blamed by many for not doing his duty that day. He, with a sufficient number of most able men, had been
      instructed to assault the north-west quarter upon the sea-side, where, at low-water, as at the time of the assault,
      the passage was easy: but neither he nor his approached the quarter appointed. At their first coming in, he had spoken
      with the Queen Regent at the front block-house of the Castle of Edinburgh. Whether she had enchanted him we knew not,
      but we suspected so that day. He certainly deceived the expectation of many, and, so far as man could judge, was the
      cause of that great repulse.... All the time of the assault, which was both terrible and long, the Queen Regent sat
      upon the fore-wall of the Castle of Edinburgh; and when she perceived our overthrow, and that the ensigns of the French
      were again displayed upon the walls, she gave a guffaw of laughter, and said, "Now will I go to the Mass, and praise
      God for that which my eyes have seen!"
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p62" shownumber="no">The French, proud of the victory, stripped naked all the slain, and laid their dead carcases in the hot sun along their wall,
      where they suffered them to lie more days than one. When the Queen Regent looked towards this, she hopped for mirth
      and said, "Yonder are the fairest tapestries that ever I saw: I would that the whole fields that are betwixt this place
      and yon were strewn with the same stuff." This act was seen by all, and her words were heard by some, and misliked
      by many. Against this, John Knox spake openly in pulpit, and boldly affirmed, that God would revenge that contumely
      done to His image, not only on the furious and godless soldiers, but even on such as rejoiced thereat. And that which
      actually happened did declare that he was not deceived, for within a few days thereafter the Queen Regent was smitten
      with disease.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p63.1">The Siege is continued. Illness of the Queen Regent.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p64" shownumber="no">The Duke of Norfolk, who then lay at Berwick, commanded the Lord Grey to continue the siege, and promised that he should
      not lack men, so long as any were to be had betwixt Trent and Tweed; so far was he lieutenant.... While the siege thus
      continued, a sudden fire chanced in Leith, and this devoured many houses and much victual. Thus did God begin to fight
      for us, as the Lord Erskine in plain words said to the Queen Regent. "Madam," quoth he, "I can say no more; but seeing
      that men may not expel unjust possessors from this land, God Himself will do it; for yon fire is not kindled by man."
      These words offended the Queen Regent not a little. Her sickness daily increasing, she used great craft that Monsieur
      D'Oysel might be permitted to speak with her. Belike she wished to bid him farewell, for of old their familiarity had
      been great; but that was denied. Then she wrote as if to her chirurgeon and apothecary, explaining her sickness and
      requiring drugs. The letter being presented to the Lord Grey, he espied craft. Few lines being written above and much
      white paper left, he said, "Drugs are abundant and fresher in Edinburgh than they can be in Leith: there lurks here
      some other mystery." By holding the paper to the fire, he perceived some writing appear, and this he read. But what
      it was, no other man can tell; for he burnt the bill immediately, and said to the messenger, "Albeit I have been her
      secretary, yet tell her I shall keep her counsel. But say to her, such wares will not sell in a new market."

      should speak with her, but not altogether, lest some part of the Guisian practice had lurked under the colour of such
      friendship. She expressed to them all regret that she had behaved herself so foolishly, and had compelled them to seek
      the support of others rather than of their own sovereign; and she said that she sore repented that ever it came to
      that extremity. But hers was<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_209">209</span> not the wyte.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iii-p65.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iii-p65.1">165</a></sup>

      other; if he had not been there, she would have fully agreed with them at their communing at Preston. They gave her
      what counsel and comfort they could in that extremity, and willed her to send for some godly learned man, of whom she
      might receive instruction; for these ignorant Papists that were about her, understood nothing of the mystery of our
      Redemption. Upon their motive, John Willock was sent for. With him she talked a reasonable space, and he did plainly
      show to her the virtue and strength of the death of Jesus Christ, as well as the vanity and abomination of the Mass.
      She did openly confess that there was no salvation but in and by the death of Jesus Christ. We heard not her confession
      concerning the Mass.

      of her former superstition. Yet, howsoever it was, Christ Jesus got no small victory over such an enemy. For, albeit
      she had formerly avowed that, in despite of all Scotland, the preachers of Jesus Christ should either die or be banished
      the realm, she was compelled not only to hear that Christ Jesus was preached, and all idolatry openly rebuked, and
      in many places suppressed, but also she was constrained to hear one of the principal ministers within the realm, and
      to approve the chief head of our religion, wherein we dissent from all Papists and papistry. Shortly thereafter she
      finished her unhappy life; unhappy, we say, for Scotland, from the first day she entered into it, to the day she departed
      this life, which was the ninth of June, the year of God 1560....

      time to the uttermost, even while those in Leith were very scarce of victuals, and those on Inchkeith would have perished,
      had not they by policy got a ship with victuals, and some munition. Yet in the end peace was concluded....

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p68.1">Public Thanksgiving in St. Giles's Kirk.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p69" shownumber="no">A day was appointed, when the whole nobility and the greatest part of the Congregation assembled in St. Giles's Kirk in Edinburgh,
      and there, after the sermon made for that purpose, public thanks was given unto God for His merciful deliverance, in
      form as follows:—
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p70" shownumber="no">"O Eternal and Everlasting God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hast not only commanded us to pray, and promised to
      hear us, but also dost will us to magnify Thy mercies, and to glorify Thy name when Thou showest Thyself pitiful and
      favourable unto us, especially when Thou deliverest us from desperate dangers, ... we ought not to forget, nor can
      we, in what miserable estate stood this poor country, and we the just inhabitants thereof, not many days past.... Out
      of these miseries, O Lord, neither our wit, policy, nor strength could deliver us; yea, they did show unto us how vain
      is the help of man, where Thy blessing gives not victory. In these our anguishes, O Lord, we made suit unto Thee, we
      cried for Thy<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_211">211</span> help, and we proclaimed Thy name, as Thy troubled flock
      persecuted for Thy truth's sake. Mercifully hast Thou heard us.... And Thou hast looked upon us as pitifully as if
      we had given unto Thee most perfect obedience, for Thou hast disappointed the counsels of the crafty, Thou hast bridled
      the rage of the cruel, and Thou hast of Thy mercy set this our perishing realm at reasonable liberty. Oh, give us hearts—Thou
      Lord, that only givest all good gifts—with reverence and fear, to meditate upon Thy wondrous works lately wrought before
      our eyes....
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p71" shownumber="no">"We beseech Thee, therefore, O Father of mercies, that, as of Thy undeserved grace Thou hast partly removed our darkness,
      suppressed idolatry, and taken from above our heads the devouring sword of merciless strangers, it would so please
      Thee to proceed with us in this Thy grace begun. Albeit that in us there is nothing that may move Thy Majesty to show
      us Thy favour, O yet for the sake of Christ Jesus, Thy only well-beloved Son, whose name we bear, and whose doctrine
      we profess, we beseech Thee never to suffer us to forsake or deny this Thy truth which now we profess.... And seeing
      that nothing is more odious in Thy presence, O Lord, than is ingratitude and violation of an oath and covenant made
      in Thy name; and seeing that Thou hast made our confederates of England the instruments by whom we are now set at liberty,
      and that to them we, in Thy name, have promised mutual faith again, let us never fall to that unkindness, O Lord, that
      either we shall declare ourselves unthankful unto them, or profaners of Thy holy name. Confound the counsels of them
      that go about to break that most godly league contracted in Thy name, and retain Thou us so firmly together by the
      power of Thy Holy Spirit, that Satan shall never have power to set us again at variance or discord. Give us Thy grace
      to live in that Christian charity which Thy Son, our Lord Jesus, has so earnestly commanded to all members of His body;
      that other nations, provoked by our example, may set aside all ungodly war, contention, and strife, and study to live
      in tranquillity and peace, as it becomes the sheep of Thy pasture, and the people that daily look for final deliverance
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_212">212</span> by the coming again of our Lord Jesus; to whom with Thee, and the

<p id="iii.iii-p72" shownumber="no">After this, the Commissioners of Burghs, with some of the nobility and barons, were appointed to see to the equal distribution

      claim to have vote therein. The assembly was great, notwithstanding that certain of those that are called spiritual
      Lords, as well as some temporal Lords, did contemptuously absent themselves. The chief pillars of the papistical kirk
      gave their presence, such as the Bishops of St. Andrews, Dunblane, and Dunkeld, with others of the inferior sort. There
      were, besides, those that had renounced papistry, and openly professed Jesus Christ with us; such as the Bishop of
      Galloway, the Abbots of Lindores, Culross, Inchcolm, Newbattle, and Holyroodhouse; the Prior of St. Andrews, Coldingham,
      and St. Mary's Isle; the Sub-prior of St. Andrews, and divers others whom we observed not.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p74.1">John Knox preaches, and Reformation is agreed upon.
</div>
<p id="iii.iii-p75" shownumber="no">At the time of Parliament, John Knox taught publicly from the Prophet Haggai. The doctrine was proper for the time; and the
      preacher was so special and so vehement in its application, that some who had greater respect to the world than to
      God's glory, feeling themselves pricked, said in mockage, "We must now forget ourselves, and bear the barrow to build
      the houses of God." God be merciful to the speaker; for we fear that he shall have experience that the building of
      his own house, the house of God being despised, shall not be so prosperous, and of such firmness, as we desire it were.
      Albeit some mocked, others were godly moved, and assembled themselves together to consult as to what things were to
      be proponed to that present Parliament. After deliberation, the following Supplication was offered by the barons, gentlemen,
      burgesses, and other true subjects of the realm, professing the Lord Jesus Christ, to the Nobility and Estates of Parliament.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p75.1">The Protestants petition Parliament.

<p id="iii.iii-p76" shownumber="no">"May it please your Honours to bring to remembrance that, at divers and sundry times, we (with some of yourselves) most humbly

      which, by the malice of Satan and the negligence of men, have crept into the religion of God, and are maintained by
      such as take upon themselves the name of clergy. Our godly and most reasonable suit was then disdainfully rejected,
      no small troubles ensuing, as your Honours well know. But now, seeing that the necessity that then moved us doth yet
      remain, and moreover, that God in His mercy hath now put it into your hands so to regulate affairs that He may be glorified,

      pronounce them to be as by us they are most justly accused, and cause them to be reputed so; especially, that they
      be decerned unworthy of honour, authority, charge, or cure within the Kirk of God, and so from henceforth never entitled
      to vote in Parliament. If ye do not so, then, in the fear of God and by the assurance of His Word, we forewarn you
      that, as ye have laid a grievous yoke and an intolerable burden upon the Kirk of God within this realm, so shall they
      be thorns in your eyes, and pricks in your sides, whom afterwards, when ye would, ye shall have no power to remove.
      God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ give you upright hearts seeking His glory, and true understanding of what this

      that uprightly favoured the cause of God, so were there many that, for worldly respects, abhorred a perfect Reformation—for
      how many within Scotland that have the name of Nobility are not unjust possessors of the patrimony of the Kirk? Yet,
      the barons and ministers were called, and commandment was given unto them to frame in plain and distinct heads the
      sum of that doctrine which they would maintain, and would desire that Parliament to establish, as wholesome, true,
      and alone necessary to be believed and to be received within that realm. This commission they willingly accepted, and
      within four days they presented their Confession of Faith.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iii-p78.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iii-p78.1">168</a></sup>

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iii-p78.2">The Confession of Faith is considered by Parliament, and solemnly ratified.

<p id="iii.iii-p79" shownumber="no">This our Confession was publicly read, first in audience of the Lords of Articles, and afterwards in audience of the whole
      Parliament. There were present a great number of the adversaries of our religion, such as the forenamed Bishops, and
      some others of the Temporal Estate, and these were commanded, in Gods name, to state any objection to that doctrine
      if they could.<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_215">215</span> Some of our ministers were present, standing upon their
      feet ready to have answered, in case any would have defended the Papistry, and impugned our affirmations. No objection
      was made, but there was a day appointed for voting on that and other matters. Again, our Confession was read over,
      every article by itself, in the order in which these were written, and the vote of every man was required. Of the Temporal
      Estate there only voted to the contrary the Earl of Atholl and the Lords Somerville and Borthwick; and yet for their
      dissent they produced no better reason than, "We will believe as our fathers believed." The Bishops (papistical, we
      mean) spake nothing. The rest of the whole three Estates, by their public votes, affirmed the doctrine.
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p80" shownumber="no">Many voted in the affirmative rather than in the negative, because the Bishops would or durst say nothing to the contrary.
      For instance, this was the vote of the Earl Marischall,—"It is long since I have had some favour unto the truth, and
      since I have had a suspicion of the papistical religion; but, I praise my God, this day has fully resolved me in the
      one and the other. For, seeing that my Lord Bishops, who for their learning can, and for the zeal that they should
      bear to the truth, would, as I suppose, gainsay anything that directly repugns to the verity of God; seeing, I say,
      my Lord Bishops here present speak nothing contrary to the doctrine proponed, I cannot but hold it to be the very truth
      of God, and the contrary to be deceivable doctrine. And therefore, so far as in me lieth, I approve the one and damn
      the other. I do further ask of God that not only I but also all my posterity may enjoy the comfort of the doctrine
      that this day our ears have heard. Yet more, I must vote, as it were by way of protestation, that, if any persons ecclesiastical
      shall after this oppose themselves to this our Confession, they shall have no place or credit; considering that, they
      having long notice and full knowledge of this our Confession, none are now found in lawful, free, and quiet Parliament
      to oppose themselves to that which we profess. And therefore, if any of this generation pretend to do it after this,
      I protest that he be repute one that loveth his own commodity and the glory of<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_216">216</span>      the world, rather than the truth of God and the salvation of men's souls."

      not to rehearse; but, in any case, no ratification was brought by him to us. That we little regarded, or yet do regard;
      for all that we did was to show our dutiful obedience, rather than to beg of them any strength to our religion. That

      sword, nor crown borne, and so on, and that some principal Lords were absent. We answer that the Queen's person was
      absent, and that to no small grief of our hearts. But were not the Estates of her realm assembled in her name? Yea,
      had they not her full power and commission, yea, the commission and commandment of her head, the King of France, to
      convocate that Parliament, and to do all things that may be done in lawful Parliament, even as if our Sovereigns had
      been there in proper person? That Parliament, we are bold to affirm, was more lawful, and more free than any Parliament
      that they are able to produce for a hundred years before it, or any that hath since ensued; for in it the votes of
      men were free, and given of conscience; in others, they were bought, or given at the devotion of the prince.

      in the matter of doctrine. This they did, and the book was presented to the Nobility, who perused it for many days.
      Some approved it, and were willing that it should have been set forth by a law. Others, perceiving their carnal liberty
      and worldly commodity somewhat to be impaired by its provisions, grudged, insomuch that the name of the Book of Discipline
      became odious unto them.... There were none within the realm more unmerciful to the poor ministers than were they which
      had greatest rents of the churches. But in that we have perceived the old proverb to be true, "Nothing can suffice

<p id="iii.iii-p86" shownumber="no">Shortly after the Parliament, the Earls Morton and Glencairn, together with William Maitland of Lethington, younger, were
      sent to England as ambassadors from the Council. The chief point of their commission was to crave earnestly the constant
      assistance of the Queen's Majesty of England against all foreign invasion, and to propose the Earl of Arran (who was
      then in no small estimation with us) to the Queen of England in marriage....

<p id="iii.iii-p87" shownumber="no">The Papists were proud, for they looked for a new army from France in the next spring, and there was no small appearance
      of this, if God had not otherwise provided. For France utterly refused to confirm the peace contracted at Leith, would
      ratify no Act of our Parliament, dismissed the Lord St. John without any resolute answer, and began to gather new bands
      of throat-cutters, and to make great preparation for ships. They further sent before<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_218">218</span>      them certain practisers to rouse up new troubles within this realm....
</p>
<p id="iii.iii-p88" shownumber="no">The certain knowledge of all these things came to our ears, and many were effrayed; for divers suspected that England would
      not be so forward in times to come, considering that their former expenses were so great. The principal comfort remained
      with the preachers. They assured us, in God's name, that God would in our hands perform that work in all perfection.
      He had mightily maintained its beginning, because it was not ours but His own. They therefore exhorted us that we should
      with constancy proceed to reform all abuses and to plant the ministry of the Church, as by God's Word we might justify
      it, and should then commit the success of all to our God, in whose power the disposition of kingdoms stands. This we
      began to do, for threatening troubles made us give ear to the admonitions of God's servants.

      wicked generation, and leave the memorial of the same to our posterity, who, alas! we fear, may forget Thy inestimable

      for credit sent a ring which the said Queen our Sovereign knew well enough. The letter and ring were both presented

      It was answered to him, that Tertullian should not prejudge the authority of the Holy Ghost, who, by the mouth of Peter,
      commands us to give reason for our faith to every one that requires the same of us. It was further answered that we
      required neither him nor any man to dispute in any point concerning our faith, which was grounded upon God's Word,
      and fully expressed within His holy Scriptures; all that we believed without controversy. But we required of him, as
      of the rest of the Papists, that they would suffer their doctrine, constitutions, and ceremonies to come to trial;
      and principally, that the Mass, and the views thereof taught by them to the people, might be laid to the square rule

      Church of the quick and the dead, etc."—Laing.</span> Now, said the reasoner, if to offer for the sins of the whole
      Kirk was not the office of Christ Jesus, yea, the office that to Him only might, and may appertain, let the Scripture
      judge. And if a vile knave, whom ye call the priest, proudly takes the same upon him, let your own book witness. The
      said Master Alexander answered, "Christ Jesus offered the propitiatory, and that could none do but He; but we offer
      the remembrance." It was answered, "We praise God, that ye have denied a sacrifice propitiatory to be in the Mass;
      and yet we offer to prove that, in more than a hundred places of your papistical Doctors, this proposition is affirmed,
      'The Mass is a sacrifice propitiatory.' But, to the second part; where ye allege that ye offer Christ in remembrance,
      we ask, first, unto whom do ye offer Him? and next, by what authority are ye assured of well doing? With God the Father,
      there is no oblivion: and if ye will yet shift and say that ye offer it not as if God were forgetful, but as willing
      to apply Christ's merits to His Church, we demand of you, what power and commandment ye have so to do? We know that
      our Master, Christ Jesus, commanded His apostles to do that which He did in remembrance of Him; but plain it is, that
      Christ took bread, gave thanks, brake bread, and gave it to His disciples, saying, 'Take ye, eat ye; this is my body
      which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me,' etc. Here ye find a commandment to take, to eat, to take and
      to drink; but to offer Christ's body either for remembrance or application, we find not: and therefore, we say, to
      take upon you an office which is not given unto you, is unjust usurpation, and no lawful power."

      He answered that he was better seen in philosophy, than in theology. Master John Leslie, who then was parson of Une,
      and now is Lord Abbot of Lindores, was commanded to answer to the former argument: and he with great gravity began
      to answer, "If our Master have nothing to say to it, I have nothing; for I know nothing but the Canon Law: and the
      greatest reason that ever I could find there is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nolumus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volumus</i>."
      And yet we understand that now he is the only patron of the Mass.... The nobility hearing that neither the one nor

      his secret poise, he barely escaped a desperate danger in Paris. The Papists at Paris, hearing of his return from our
      Sovereign, who then lay with the Cardinal of Lorraine at Rheims, had conspired some treasonable act against him; for
      they intended either to beset his house by night, or else to have assaulted him and his company as they walked upon
      the streets. Of this the said Lord James was informed by the Rheingrave, by reason of old familiarity betwixt them
      in Scotland, and he took purpose suddenly and in good order to depart<span class="pb" id="iii.iii-Page_223">223</span>      from Paris. This he did on the second day after he had arrived there. He could not, however, depart so secretly, but
      that the Papists had their privy ambushes. They had prepared a procession, which met the said Lord and his company
      even in the teeth upon the Pont du Change; and knowing that the Scots would not do the accustomed reverence unto them
      and their idols, they thought to have picked a quarrel. So, as one part passed by without moving of hat to anything
      that was there, they had suborned some to cry "Huguenots," and to cast stones. But God disappointed their enterprise;
      for the Rheingrave and other gentlemen, being with the Lord James, rebuked the foolish multitude, and overrode some
      of the foremost. The rest were dispersed; and he and his company safely escaped, and came with expedition to Edinburgh,

      Yea, what wisdom or worldly policy was in us, to have brought to a good end so great an enterprise? Our very enemies

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p5" shownumber="no">On the nineteenth day of August, in the year of God 1561, betwixt seven and eight o'clock in the morning, Mary Queen of Scotland,
      then widow, arrived with two galleys, from France. In her company (besides her gentlewomen, called the Marys) were
      her three uncles, the Duke D'Aumale, the Grand Prior, and the Marquis d'Elbœuf. There accompanied her also De Damville,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_227">227</span> son to the Constable of France, with other gentlemen of inferior condition,
      besides servants and officers. The very face of heaven, at the time of her arrival, did manifestly proclaim what comfort
      was brought unto this country with her, to wit, sorrow, dolour, darkness, and all impiety; for in the memory of man,
      there had never been seen, on that day of the year, a more dolorous face of the heaven, than at her arrival. And so
      it continued for two days: besides the surface wet, and corruption of the air, the mist was so thick and so dark, that
      scarcely might any man espy another the length of two pair of boots. The sun was not seen to shine for two days before,
      nor for two days after. That fore-warning gave God unto us; but, alas, the most part were blind.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p6" shownumber="no">At the sound of the cannons which the galleys shot, the multitude were notified, and happy was he or she that first might
      attain the presence of the Queen. The Protestants were not the slowest, and therein they were not to be blamed. Because
      the Palace of Holyroodhouse was not thoroughly put in order (for her coming was more sudden than many looked for) she
      remained in Leith until towards the evening, and then repaired thither. In the way betwixt Leith and the Abbey, the
      rebels of the crafts, who had violated the authority of the magistrates, and had besieged the Provost, met the Queen.
      But, because she was sufficiently instructed that all they had done was in despite of religion, they were easily pardoned.
      Fires of joy were set forth all night, and a company of the most honest, with instruments of music and musicians, gave
      their salutations at her chamber window. The melody, as she alleged, liked her well; and she willed the same to be
      continued for some nights after.

      be suffered again to take its place within this realm? It shall not." The Lord<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_228">228</span>      Lyndsay, then but Master, with the gentlemen of Fife, and others, plainly cried in the close, "The idolater Priest
      should die the death," according to God's law. One that carried in the candle was evil effrayed; but then began flesh
      and blood to show itself. No Papist, or yet any that came out of France, durst whisper. But the Lord James, the man
      whom all the godly did most reverence, took upon him to keep the chapel door. His best excuse was that he would stop
      all Scotsmen from entering in to the Mass. But it was and is sufficiently known that the door was kept, that none should
      have entrance to trouble the priest. After the Mass, he was committed to the protection of Lord John of Coldingham,
      and Lord Robert of Holyroodhouse, who then were both Protestants, and had communicated at the Table of the Lord. Betwixt
      them two was the priest convoyed to his chamber.

      signification that they could not abide that the land, which God by His power had purged from idolatry, should be polluted

      they would return to France without delay: they could not live without the Mass. The Queen's uncles affirmed the same.

<p id="iii.iv-p9" shownumber="no">The Council having assembled, disputation was had as to what was the next remedy. Politic heads were sent to the gentlemen,
      with these and like persuasions, "Why, alas, will ye chase our Sovereign from us? She will incontinently return to
      her galleys; and what then shall all realms say of us? May we not suffer her a little while? We doubt not but that

      should be as great enemies to her Mass as ye be. Her uncles will depart, and then shall we rule all at our pleasure.
      Would not we be as sorry to hurt the religion as would any of you?" With these and the like persuasions, the fervency

<p id="iii.iv-p10" shownumber="no">This Act and Proclamation, penned and put in form by men who had formerly professed Christ Jesus (for Papists had then neither
      power nor vote in the Council) was publicly proclaimed at the Market Cross of Edinburgh. No man reclaimed or made repugnance
      to it, with the sole exception of the Earl of Arran. He, in open audience of the heralds and people, protested that
      he dissented that any protection or defence should be made for the Queen's domestics or any that came from France,
      permitting to them more than to any other subject to offend God's Majesty, and to violate the laws of the realm. God's
      law had pronounced death against the idolater, and the laws of the realm had appointed punishment for sayers and hearers
      of the Mass. "I here protest," said he, "that these ought to be universally observed, and that none should be exempted,
      until such time as a law, as publicly made and as consonant to the law of God, shall have disannulled the former."

<p id="iii.iv-p11" shownumber="no">This boldness somewhat exasperated the Queen, and such as favoured her in that matter. As the Lords, now called the Lords
      of the Congregation, repaired to the town, they at the first coming showed themselves wondrously offended that the
      Mass was permitted; so that every man, as he came, accused those that had arrived before him: but after they had remained
      a certain time, they became as quiet as those who had preceded them. This perceived, a zealous and godly man, Robert
      Campbell of Kinyeancleuch, said to the Lord Ochiltree, "My Lord, ye are come almost the last of all; and I perceive
      by your anger that the fire-edge is not off you yet; but I fear that, after the holy water of the Court shall be sprinkled

      say, 'Let us hang the<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_230">230</span> priest;' but, after they had been twice or thrice
      at the Abbey, all that fervency was past. I think there must be some enchantment whereby men are bewitched." And, in

      to believe—"She will be content to hear the preaching; and so no doubt but she may be won." And thus by all it was
      concluded to suffer her for a time.

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p12" shownumber="no">On the next Sunday, John Knox, inveighing against idolatry, showed what terrible plagues God had laid upon realms and nations
      for this; and added that one Mass (there were no more suffered at the first) was more fearful to him than if ten thousand
      armed enemies were landed in any part of the realm, for the purpose of suppressing the whole religion. "In our God,"
      said he, "there is strength to resist and confound multitudes, if we unfeignedly depend upon Him; and of this we have
      had experience heretofore. But when we join hands with idolatry, there is no doubt that both God's amicable presence
      and comfortable defence leave us, and what shall then become of us? Alas, I fear that experience shall teach us, to
      the grief of many." At these words, the guiders of the Court mocked, and plainly said that such fear was no point of
      their faith: it was outside his text, and was a very untimely admonition....
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p12.1">John Knox reasons with the Queen.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p13" shownumber="no">Whether it was by counsel of others, or of the Queen's own desire, we know not; but the Queen spake with John Knox, and had
      long reasoning with him, none being present except the Lord James: two gentlewomen stood at the other end of the apartment.
      The sum of their reasoning was this. The Queen accused him of having raised a part of her subjects against her mother
      and against herself. He had, she said, written a book against her just authority (she meant the treatise against the
      regiment of<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_231">231</span> women) which she had, and she should cause the most learned
      in Europe to write against it; he was the cause of great sedition and great slaughter in England; she was informed
      that all he did was by necromancy, and so on.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p14" shownumber="no">The said John answered, "Madam, it may please your Majesty patiently to hear my simple answers. And first," said he, "if
      to teach the truth of God in sincerity, if to rebuke idolatry, and to will a people to worship God according to His
      Word, be to raise subjects against their princes, then can I not be excused; for it has pleased God in His mercy to
      make me one, amongst many, to disclose unto this realm the vanity of the papistical religion, and the deceit, pride,
      and tyranny of that Roman Antichrist. But, Madam, if the true knowledge of God and His right worshipping be the chief
      causes that must move men from their heart to obey their just princes, as it is most certain that they are, wherein
      can I be reprehended? I think, and am surely persuaded, that your Grace has had, and presently has, as unfeigned obedience
      from such as profess Jesus Christ within this realm, as ever your father, or other progenitors had from those that
      were called bishops. And, touching that book which seemeth so highly to offend your Majesty, it is most certain that
      I wrote it, and am content that all the learned of the world should judge of it. I hear that an Englishman hath written
      against it, but I have not read him. If he have sufficiently improved my reasons, and established his contrary proposition,
      with as evident testimonies as I have done mine, I shall not be obstinate, but shall confess my error and ignorance.
      But to this hour I have thought, and yet think myself alone to be more able to sustain the things affirmed in that
      work, than any ten in Europe shall be able to confute it."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p15" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> Ye think, then, that I have no just authority?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p16" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> Please, your Majesty, learned men in all ages have had their judgments free, and most commonly disagreeing
      from the common judgment of the world; such also have they published, both with pen and tongue, and yet they themselves
      have lived in common society with others, and have borne patiently with the errors and imperfections which they could
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_232">232</span> not amend. Plato, the philosopher, wrote his book of <cite id="iii.iv-p16.1">The
      Commonwealth</cite>. In this he damned many things that then were maintained in the world, and required many things
      to be reformed; and yet he lived under such polities as then were universally received, without further troubling any
      state. Even so, Madam, am I content to do, in uprightness of heart, and with the testimony of a good conscience. I
      have communicated my judgment to the world; if the realm finds no inconvenience from the regiment of a woman, that
      which they approve shall I not disallow, further than within my own breast. I shall be as well content to live under
      your Grace as Paul was to live under Nero; and my hope is that, so long as ye defile not your hands with the blood
      of the saints of God, neither I nor that book shall either hurt you or your authority: for, in very deed, Madam, that
      book was written most especially against that wicked Jezebel of England.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p17" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> But ye speak of women in general.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p18" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> Most true it is, Madam, and yet it appeareth to me that wisdom should persuade your Grace never to raise
      trouble for that which to this day hath not troubled your Majesty, in person or in authority. Of late years, many things,
      which before were holden stable, have been called in doubt; yea, they have been plainly impugned. But yet, Madam, I
      am assured that neither Protestant nor Papist shall be able to prove that any such question was at any time moved in
      public or in secret. Now, Madam, if I had intended to have troubled your estate because ye are a woman, I might have
      chosen a time more convenient for that purpose than I can do now, when your own presence is within the realm.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p19" shownumber="no">But now, Madam, shortly to answer to the other two accusations. I heartily praise my God, through Jesus Christ, that Satan,
      the enemy of mankind, and the wicked of the world, have no other crimes to lay to my charge, than such as the very
      world itself knoweth to be most false and vain. I was resident in England for only the space of five years. The places
      were Berwick, where I abode two years; so long in Newcastle; and a year in London. Now, Madam, if any man<span class="pb"
            id="iii.iv-Page_233">233</span> shall be able to prove that there was either battle, sedition, or mutiny in any of
      these places, during the time that I was there, I shall confess that I myself was the malefactor, and the shedder of
      the blood. Further, Madam, I am not ashamed to affirm that God so blessed my weak labours that, in Berwick, where commonly
      before there used to be slaughter, by reason of quarrels that used to arise amongst soldiers, there was as great quietness,
      all the time that I remained there, as there is this day in Edinburgh. And where they slander me of magic, necromancy,
      or of any other art forbidden by God, I have, besides my own conscience, all congregations that ever heard me as witnesses
      that I spake against such arts, and against those that use such impiety....
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p20" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> But yet ye have taught the people to receive another religion than their princes can allow. How can that
      doctrine be of God, seeing that God commands subjects to obey their princes?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p21" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> Madam, as right religion took neither original strength nor authority from worldly princes, but from the
      Eternal God alone, subjects are not bound to frame their religion according to the appetites of their princes. Oft
      it is that princes are the most ignorant of all others in God's true religion, as we may read in the histories of times
      before the death of Christ Jesus, as well as after. If all the seed of Abraham should have been of the religion of
      Pharaoh, to whom they were long subjects, I pray you, Madam, what religion should there have been in the world? Or,
      if all men in the days of the Apostles should have been of the religion of the Roman Emperors, what religion should
      there have been upon the face of the earth? Daniel and his fellows were subjects to Nebuchadnezzar, and to Darius,
      and yet, Madam, they would not be of their religion: for the three children said, "We make it known unto thee, O King,
      that we will not worship thy gods." And Daniel did pray publicly to his God against the expressed commandment of the
      King. And so, Madam, ye may perceive that subjects are not bound to the religion of their princes, albeit they are
      commanded to give them obedience.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p22" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_234">234</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p23" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> Yea, but none of these men raised the sword against their princes.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p24" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> Yet, Madam, ye cannot deny that they resisted: for, in some sort, these resist that obey not the commandments
      that are given.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p25" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> But yet, they resisted not by the sword.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p26" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> God, Madam, had not given unto them the power and the means.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p27" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> Think ye, that subjects having power may resist their princes.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p28" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> If their princes exceed their bounds, Madam, no doubt they should be resisted, even by power. For there
      is neither greater honour, nor greater obedience to be given to kings or princes, than God has commanded to be given
      to father and mother. But, Madam, the father may be stricken with a frenzy, in which he would slay his own children.
      Now, Madam, if the children arise, join themselves together, apprehend the father, take the sword or other weapons
      from him, and finally bind his hands, and keep him in prison, until his frenzy be overpast; think ye, Madam, that the
      children do any wrong? Or, think ye, Madam, that God will be offended with them that have stayed their father from
      committing wickedness? It is even so, Madam, with princes that would murder the children of God that are subject unto
      them. Their blind zeal is nothing but a very mad frenzy; and, therefore, to take the sword from them, to bind their
      hands, and to cast them into prison until they be brought to a more sober mind, is no disobedience against princes,
      but just obedience, because it agreeth with the will of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p29" shownumber="no">At these words the Queen stood as it were amazed, for more than quarter of an hour. Her countenance altered, so that Lord
      James began to entreat her, and to demand, "What has offended you, Madam."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p30" shownumber="no">At length she said, "Well, then, I perceive that my subjects shall obey you, and not me; and shall do what they list, and
      not what I command: and so must I be subject to them, and not they to me."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p31" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> God forbid, that ever I take upon me to<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_235">235</span> command any to
      obey me, or yet to set subjects at liberty to do what pleaseth them. But my travail is that both princes and subjects
      obey God. And think not, Madam, that wrong is done to you when ye are willed to be subject to God. It is He that subjects
      people under princes, and causes obedience to be given to them; yea, God craves of kings that they be, as it were,
      foster-fathers to His Church, and commands queens to be nurses to His people. And, Madam, this subjection to God and
      to His troubled Church is the greatest dignity that flesh can get upon the face of the earth, for it shall carry them
      to everlasting glory.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p32" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> Yea, but ye are not the Kirk that I will nurse. I will defend the Kirk of Rome, for I think it is the
      true Kirk of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p33" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> Your will, Madam, is no reason; neither doth your thought make of that Roman harlot the true and immaculate
      spouse of Jesus Christ. Wonder not, Madam, that I call Rome a harlot; for that Church is altogether polluted with all
      kind of spiritual fornication, as well in doctrine as in manners. Yea, Madam, I offer myself further to prove that
      the Church of the Jews that crucified Christ Jesus, when it manifestly denied the Son of God, was not so far degenerated
      from the ordinances and statutes which God gave by Moses and Aaron unto His people, as the Church of Rome is declined,
      and for more than five hundred years hath declined from the purity of that religion which the Apostles taught and planted.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p34" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> My conscience is not so.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p35" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> Conscience, Madam, requires knowledge; and I fear that right knowledge ye have none.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p36" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> But I have both heard and read.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p37" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> So, Madam, did the Jews that crucified Christ Jesus read both the Law and the Prophets, and heard the same
      interpreted after their manner. Have ye heard any teach, but such as the Pope and his Cardinals have allowed? Ye may
      be assured that such will speak nothing to offend their own estate.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p38" shownumber="no"><i>Queen Mary.</i> Ye interpret the Scriptures in one manner,<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_236">236</span> and they interpret
      in another; whom shall I believe? And who shall be judge?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p39" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> Ye shall believe God, that plainly speaketh in His Word: and, farther than the Word teaches you, ye shall
      believe neither the one nor the other. The Word of God is plain in itself; and, if there appear any obscurity in one
      place, the Holy Ghost, who is never contrary to Himself, explains the same more clearly in other places: so that there
      can remain no doubt, but to such as obstinately remain ignorant. And now, Madam, take one of the chief points this
      day in controversy betwixt the Papists and us. For example, the Papists allege and boldly have affirmed that the Mass
      is the ordinance of God, and the institution of Jesus Christ, and a sacrifice for the sins of the quick and the dead.
      We deny both the one and the other, and affirm that the Mass, as it is now used, is nothing but the invention of man;
      and, therefore, is an abomination before God, and no sacrifice that ever God commanded. Now, Madam, who shall judge
      betwixt us two thus contending? There is no reason that either of the parties be believed farther than they are able
      to prove by insuspect witnessing. Let them lay down the Book of God and, by the plain words thereof, prove their affirmation,
      and we shall give them the plea granted. But so long as they are bold to affirm, and yet do prove nothing, we must
      say that, albeit all the world believe them, yet they believe not God, but receive the lies of men for the truth of
      God. What our Master Jesus Christ did, we know from His Evangelists: what the priest doeth at his Mass, the world seeth.
      Now, doth not the Word of God plainly assure us that Christ Jesus neither said, nor yet commanded Mass to be said at
      His Last Supper, seeing that no such thing as their Mass is made mention of within the whole Scriptures?

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p51.2">The Magistrates of Edinburgh are imprisoned and deposed.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p52" shownumber="no">It hath been an ancient and a laudable custom in Edinburgh that the Provost, Bailies, and Council, after their election at
      Michaelmas, cause public proclamation of the statutes and ordinances of the town. Therefore Archibald Douglas, Provost,
      Edward Hope, Adam Fullerton, Mr. James Watson, and David Somer, Bailies, made proclamation, according to the former
      statutes of the town, that no adulterer, no fornicator, no noted drunkard, no mass-monger, no obstinate Papists that
      corrupted the people, such as priests, friars, and others of that sort, should be found within the town within forty-eight
      hours thereafter, under the pains contained in the statutes. This blown in the Queen's<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_239">239</span>      ears, pride and maliciousness began to show themselves; for, without further intimation, the Provost and Bailies were
      charged to ward in the Castle; and immediately commandment was given that another Provost and other Bailies should
      be elected.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p53" shownumber="no">Some gainstood the new election for a while, alleging that the Provost and Bailies whom they had chosen, and to whom they
      had given their oath, had committed no offence for which they ought justly to be deprived. But charge was doubled upon
      charge, and, no man being found to oppose the iniquity, Jezebel's letter and wicked will were obeyed as law. So Mr.
      Thomas M'Calzean was chosen. The man, no doubt, was both discreet and sufficient for that charge; but the deposition
      of the other was against all law. God be merciful to some of our own; for they were not all blameless that her wicked
      will was so far obeyed.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p54" shownumber="no">A contrary proclamation was publicly made, to the effect that the town should be patent unto all the Queen's lieges; and
      so murderers, adulterers, thieves, whores, drunkards, idolaters, and all malefactors, got protection under the Queen's
      wings, under that colour, because they were of her religion. And so gat the Devil freedom again, where before he durst
      not have been seen in daylight upon the common streets. "Lord deliver us from that bondage."

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p54.1">The Mass is restored.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p55" shownumber="no">The Devil, finding his reins loose, ran forward in his course; and the Queen took upon her greater boldness than she and
      Baal's bleating priests durst have attempted before. For, upon Allhallow Day, they blended their Mass with all mischievous
      solemnity. The ministers, offended, declared in plain and public place the inconveniences that should ensue, and the
      nobility were sufficiently admonished of their duties. But affection caused men to call in doubt that wherein shortly
      before they had seemed to be most resolute, to wit, "Whether subjects might put to their hand to suppress the idolatry
      of their Prince." Upon this question, there convened, in the house of Mr. James Macgill, the Lord James, the Earl of
      Morton, the Earl Marischall, Secretary Lethington, the Justice Clerk, and the Clerk of Register. All reasoned for the
      part of<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_240">240</span> the Queen, affirming that the subjects might not lawfully take
      her Mass from her. Of the contrary judgment were the principal ministers, Mr. John Row, Master George Hay, Master Robert
      Hamilton, and John Knox....
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p56" shownumber="no">The conclusion of that first reasoning was that the question should be put in form, and letters directed to Geneva for the
      resolution of that Church. Therein John Knox offered his labours; but Secretary Lethington, alleging that much depended
      on the information, said that he should write. But that was only to drive time, as the truth declared itself. The Queen's
      party urged that the Queen should have her religion free in her own chapel, that she and her household might do what
      they should list. The ministers both affirmed and voted to the contrary, adding that her liberty should be their thraldom
      before long. But neither could reason nor threatening move the affections of such as were creeping into credit, and
      the votes of the Lords prevailed against those of the ministers.

      the town was called to the watch. Lords Robert of Holyroodhouse and John of Coldingham kept the watch by turns. Scouts
      were sent forth, and sentinels were commanded, under pain of death, to keep their stations. Yet they feared, where
      there was no cause for fear: nor could ever any appearance or suspicion of such things be discovered.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p60.3">The Influence of the Court is felt in the Kirk.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p61" shownumber="no">The General Assembly of the Church was held in the December after the Queen's arrival. There the rulers of the Court began
      to draw themselves apart from the society of their brethren, and to sturr<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p61.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p61.1">189</a></sup>

      very fervent in the cause of God, and forward in giving his counsel in all doubtful matters, plainly refused ever to
      assist the Assembly again. At this many did wonder. The courtiers drew to them some of the Lords, and would not convene
      with their brethren, as had been their former custom, remaining at the Abbey instead. The principal commissioners of
      the churches, the superintendents, and some ministers went to see them at the Abbot's lodging<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_242">242</span>      within Holyroodhouse. Both the parties began to open their grief.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p61.2">The Ministers reproach the defaulting Lords.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p62" shownumber="no">The Lords complained that the ministers drew the gentlemen into secret councils without their knowledge. The ministers denied
      that they had done anything in secret, or otherwise than the Common Order commanded them; and accused the Lords, the
      flatterers of the Queen we mean, for not having kept convention with their brethren, considering that they knew the
      order, and that the same was appointed by their own advices, as the Book of Discipline, subscribed by the hands of
      the most part of them, would witness. Some began to deny that ever they knew such a thing as the Book of Discipline;
      and also called in doubt whether it was expedient that such conventions should be held; for gladly would the Queen
      and her Secret Council have had all assemblies of the godly discharged.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p63" shownumber="no">The reasoning was sharp and quick on either part. The Queen's faction alleged that it was suspicious to Princes that subjects
      should assemble themselves and keep conventions without their knowledge. It was answered that the Church did nothing
      without knowledge of the Prince. The Prince perfectly understood that within this realm there was a Reformed Church,
      and that they had their orders and appointed times of convention. "Yea," said Lethington, "the Queen knew and knoweth
      it well enough; but the question is, whether the Queen allows such conventions?" It was answered, "If the liberty of
      the Church should stand upon the Queen's allowance or disallowance, we are assured not only to lack assemblies, but
      also the public preaching of the Evangel."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p64" shownumber="no">That affirmative was mocked, and the contrary was affirmed. "Well," said the other, "time will try the truth; but to my former
      words this will I add—take from us the freedom of assemblies, and take from us the Evangel; for, without assemblies,
      how shall good order and unity in doctrine be kept? It is not to be supposed that all ministers shall be so perfect,
      but that they shall need admonition, concerning<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_243">243</span> manners as well as
      doctrine. It may be that some shall be so stiff-necked that they will not admit the admonition of the simple. It may
      be that fault may be found with ministers, without just offence committed. Yet, if order be not taken, both with the
      complainer and the persons complained upon, it cannot be avoided that many grievous offences shall arise. For remedy
      of these, General Assemblies are necessary. There, the judgment and the gravity of many concur to correct or to repress
      the follies or errors of a few." The majority of the Nobility and of the Barons assented to this, and willed the reasoners
      for the part of the Queen to desire that, if her Grace were suspicious of anything that was to be dealt with in their
      Assemblies, she should be pleased to send such as she would appoint, to hear whatsoever was proponed or reasoned.

<p id="iii.iv-p65" shownumber="no">After that, the Book of Discipline was put forward, with request that it should be ratified by the Queen's Majesty. That

      was answered, "All the godly." "Will the Duke?" said Lethington. "If he will not," answered the Lord Ochiltree, "I
      would that he were scraped out, not only from that Book, but also from our number and company. For to what purpose
      shall labours be taken to put the Kirk in order, and to what end shall men subscribe, and then never mean to keep a
      word of that which they promise?" Lethington answered, "Many subscribed there <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in fide parentum</i>,
      as the bairns are baptized." John Knox answered, "Albeit ye think that scoff proper, yet, as it is most untrue, so
      is it most improper. That Book was read in public audience, and by the space of divers days the heads thereof were
      reasoned, as all that here sit know well enough, and ye yourself cannot deny; no man was required to subscribe that
      which he understood not." "Stand content," said one, "that Book will not be obtained." "Let God," said the other, "require
      the lack which this poor Commonwealth shall have of the things therein contained, from the hands of such as stop the
      same."

<p id="iii.iv-p67" shownumber="no">The Barons, perceiving that the Book of Discipline was refused, presented certain Articles to the Council, requiring idolatry
      to be suppressed, their churches to be planted with true ministers, and some certain provision to be made for these,
      according to equity and conscience; for, until that time, the most part of the ministers had lived upon the benevolence
      of men. Many held in their own hands the fruits that the bishops and others of that sect had formerly abused; and so
      some part was bestowed upon the ministers. But then the bishops began to grip again at that which most unjustly they
      called their own; for the Earl of Arran was discharged of St. Andrews and Dunfermline, with which, by virtue of a factory,
      he had formerly intromitted: and so were many others. Therefore the Barons required that arrangements might be made
      for their ministers. Otherwise, they would obey the bishops no more, nor would they suffer anything to be taken for
      their use, more than they did before the Queen's arrival. They verily supposed that the Queen's Majesty would keep
      promise made to them, not to alter their religion. That could not remain without ministers, and ministers could not
      live without provision. For these reasons, they heartily desired the Council to provide some convenient order in that
      respect.

      be happy, my judgment faileth me; for I am assured that the Spirit of God is not the author of it. First I see two
      parts freely given to the Devil, and then the third must be divided betwixt God and the Devil. Bear witness to me that
      this day I say it—before long the Devil shall have three parts of the third; judge what God's portion shall then be."
      This was an unsavoury saying in the ears of many. Some were not ashamed to affirm, "The ministers being sustained,
      the Queen will not, at the year's end, have enough to buy her a pair of new shoes." And this was Secretary Lethington.

      The Laird of Pittarrow was appointed to pay the ministers' stipends, according to their modification. Who would have
      thought that, when Joseph ruled Egypt, his brethren should have travelled for victuals, and have returned to their
      families with empty sacks? Men would rather have thought that Pharaoh's poise, treasure, and girnells should have been
      diminished, before the household of Jacob should have stood in danger of starving for hunger.

<p id="iii.iv-p71" shownumber="no">So busy and circumspect were the modificators (because it was a new office, the term must also be new) to secure that the
      ministers should not be too wanton, a hundred marks was considered sufficient for a single man, being a common minister.
      Three hundred marks was the highest stipend appointed to any, except to the superintendents, and a few others. Shortly,
      whether it was from the niggardliness of their own hearts, or the care that they had to enrich the Queen, we know not;
      but the poor ministers, readers, and exhorters cried out to the heaven, as their complaints in all Assemblies do witness,
      that neither were they able to live upon the stipends appointed, nor could they get payment<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_246">246</span>      of that small thing that was appointed. The Comptroller would fain have played the good valet, and have satisfied the
      Queen, or else his own profit, in every point; and he got this saying and proverb, "The good Laird of Pittarrow was
      an earnest professor of Christ; but the big Devil receive the Comptroller, for he and his collectors are become greedy

<p id="iii.iv-p72" shownumber="no">We put an end to this unpleasing story. When the brethren complained of their poverty, it was disdainfully answered by some,
      "There are many Lords that have not so much to spend." Men did reason that the vocation of ministers craved books,
      quietness, study, and travel, to edify the Kirk of Jesus Christ, while many Lairds were waiting upon their worldly
      business. The stipends of ministers, who had no other industry, but had to live upon that which was appointed, ought
      therefore not to be modified according to the livings of common men, who might and did daily augment their rents by
      some other industry. But they gat no other answer than, "The Queen can spare no greater sums." Oft was it cried into
      their ears, "O happy servants of the Devil, and miserable servants of Jesus Christ; if after this life there were not
      hell and heaven." To the servants of the Devil, to your dumb dogs and horned bishops, to one of those idle bellies,
      I say, ten thousand was not enough; but to the servants of Christ that painfully preach His Evangel, a thousand pounds;
      how can that be defended?

<p id="iii.iv-p73" shownumber="no">One day, in reasoning of this matter, the Secretary burst out in a piece of his choler, and said, "The ministers have so
      much paid to them year by year, and who yet ever bade the Queen 'grand-mercies' for it? Was there ever a minister that
      gave thanks to God for her Majesty's liberality towards them?" One smiled and answered, "Assuredly, I think that such
      as receive anything gratis of the Queen, are unthankful if they acknowledge it not, both in heart and mouth. But whether
      the ministers be of that rank or not, I greatly doubt. Gratis, I am assured, they receive nothing; and whether they
      receive anything at<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_247">247</span> all from the Queen, wise men may reason. I am assured
      that neither Third nor 'Two-part' ever appertained to any of her predecessors within this realm these thousand years
      by-past, nor yet has the Queen better title to that which she usurps, be it in giving to others or in taking to herself,
      than had such as crucified Jesus to divide His garments amongst them. If the truth may be spoken, she has not so good
      title as they had; for such spoil used to be the reward of such men. And these soldiers were more gentle than the Queen
      and her flatterers, for they parted not the garments of our Master until He Himself was hung upon the cross; but she
      and her flatterers do part the spoil while poor Christ is yet preaching amongst you. But the wisdom of our God makes
      trial of us by this means, knowing well enough what she and her faction have purposed to do. Let the Papists, who have
      some the Two-parts, some their Thirds free, and some abbacies and feu lands, thank the Queen, and sing, '

<p id="iii.iv-p77" shownumber="no">This winter, the Earl Bothwell, the Marquis D'Elbœuf, and Lord John of Coldingham, played riot in Edinburgh, misordered the
      whole town, broke Cuthbert Ramsay's gates and doors, and searched his house for his good-daughter,<sup class="Note"
            id="fna_iii.iv-p77.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p77.1">196</a></sup><span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.iv-p77.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.iv-p77.1">196</a></sup>Daughter-in-law.</span>      Alison Craik. This was done in despite of the Earl of Arran, whose mistress the said Alison was suspected to have been.
      The horror of this fact, and the rarity of it, highly commoved all godly hearts. The Assembly and the nobility were
      in the town for the most part; and they concluded to crave justice by supplication. This they did....
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p78" shownumber="no">This supplication was presented by divers gentlemen. At first the flatterers of the Court stormed, and asked, "Who durst
      avow it?" The Master, now Lord Lyndsay, answered, "A thousand gentlemen within Edinburgh." Others were ashamed to oppose
      themselves to the supplication in public; but they suborned the Queen to give a gentle answer until such time as the
      Convention was dissolved. This she did; for she lacks no craft, both to cloak and to maintain impiety. She alleged
      that her uncle was a stranger and had a young company; but that she should put such order to him, and unto all others,
      that thereafter they should have no occasion to complain....
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p79" shownumber="no">But punishment of that enormity and fearful attempt we could get none: more and more they presumed to do<span class="pb"
            id="iii.iv-Page_249">249</span> violence, and frequented nightly masking. Some, as Robin Craig's household, because
      his daughter was fair, delighted therein; others lamented, and began to bear the matter very heavily. At length, the
      Lord Duke's friends assembled one night upon the causeway. The Abbot of Kilwinning (who then was joined to the Church,
      and, as we understand, doth yet abide so) was the principal man at the beginning. To him repaired many faithful; and
      amongst others came Andrew Stewart, Lord Ochiltree, a man rather born to make peace than to brag upon the causeway,
      and demanded the quarrel. Being informed of the former enormity, he said, "Nay, such impiety shall not be suffered
      so long as God shall assist us. By His grace, we will maintain the victory that God in His mercy hath given." So he
      commanded his son, Andrew Stewart, then Master, and his servants to put themselves in order, and to bring forth their
      spears and long weapons; and thus did others.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p80" shownumber="no">Word came to the Earl Bothwell and his party that the Hamiltons were upon the gait.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p80.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p80.1">197</a></sup>

      Coldingham had married the Earl Bothwell's sister, a sufficient woman for such a man; others drew the Lord Robert;
      and so they both joined with the Earl Bothwell. But the stoutness of the Marquis Le Bœuf, D'Elbœuf they call him, is
      most to be commended; for in his chamber, within the Abbey, he started to a halbert, and ten men were scarcely able
      to hold him; but, as hap was, the inner gate of the Abbey kept him that night. The danger was betwixt the Cross and
      the Salt Tron; and so he was a large quarter of a mile from the shot and slanting<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p80.2"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p80.2">198</a></sup>

      all that would assist him, should resist him in the face: these words did somewhat beat down that blast. The Earls
      of Huntly and Moray,

      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_250">250</span> tumult. This they did; for Bothwell and his party were commanded to
      keep their lodgings, under pain of treason.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p80.4">Plots against the Earl of Moray.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p81" shownumber="no">It was whispered by many that the desire for a quarrel with the Earl of Moray was as strong as was any hatred that the Hamiltons
      bore against the Earl Bothwell, or he against them. Indeed, either had the Duke very false servants, or else the Earl
      of Moray's death was conspired oftener than once by Huntly and the Hamiltons. Suspicion of this burst forth so far
      that one day the said Earl, being upon horse to come to the sermon, was charged by one of the Duke's own servants to
      return and abide with the Queen.

<p id="iii.iv-p82" shownumber="no">The Earl Bothwell, by means of James Barron, burgess
      <sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p82.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p82.1">200</a></sup><span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.iv-p82.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.iv-p82.1">200</a></sup>Inhabitant with full municipal right.</span>      and merchant of Edinburgh, desired to speak with John Knox secretly. The said John gladly granted this request, and
      spake with him one night, first in the said James's lodging, and thereafter in his own study. The said Earl lamented
      his former inordinate life, and especially that he had been provoked by the enticements of the Queen Regent to do that
      which he sorely repented, as well as his conduct towards the Laird of Ormiston, whose blood had been spilt, albeit
      not by his fault. But his chief dolour was that he had misbehaved himself against the Earl of Arran, whose favours
      he was most willing to redeem, if it were possible that he might do so. He desired the said John to give him his best
      counsel. "For," said he, "if I might have my Lord of Arran's favours, I would wait upon the Court with a page and few
      servants, to spare my expenses. At present I am compelled, for my own safety, to keep a number of wicked and unprofitable
      men, to the utter destruction of what of my living there is left."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p83" shownumber="no">The said John answered, "My Lord, would to God that in me were counsel or judgment that might comfort and relieve you. Albeit
      to this hour it hath not chanced me to speak with your Lordship face to face, yet have I borne a good mind to your
      house; and I have been sorry at my heart concerning the troubles that I have heard you to be involved in. My<span class="pb"

      all men may embrace the same, and they cannot do this perfectly so long as there remaineth in them rancour, malice,
      or envy. I am very sorry that ye have given occasion to men to be offended with you; but I am more sorry that ye have
      offended the Majesty of God, who by such means oft punishes the other sins of man. Therefore, my counsel is that ye
      begin at God; if ye will enter into perfect reconciliation with Him, I doubt not but He shall bow the hearts of men
      to forget all offences. As for me, if ye continue in godliness, your Lordship may command me as boldly as any that
      serves your Lordship."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p84" shownumber="no">The said Lord desired John Knox that he would sound the Earl of Arran as to whether he would be content to receive him into
      his favour. This he promised to do; and he so earnestly travailed in that matter, that it was once brought to a conclusion
      and agreement, such as caused all the faithful to praise God. The greatest stay<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p84.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p84.1">203</a></sup>

      pursued by the said Lord Bothwell, his son Master Alexander Cockburn taken by him, and carried with him to Borthwick,
      but gently enough sent back again.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p84.2">The Reconciliation of the Earl of Arran and the Earl Bothwell.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p85" shownumber="no">That new trouble so greatly displeased John Knox, that he almost gave over farther travailing for amity. But yet, upon receiving
      the excuse of the said Earl, and after the declaration of his mind, he re-entered upon his labours, and brought it
      to pass that the Laird of Ormiston referred his satisfaction in all things to the judgments of the Earls of Arran and
      Moray. To them the said Earl Bothwell submitted himself in that respect, and thereupon delivered his handwrit. He was
      convoyed by certain of his friends to the lodging of the Kirk-of-Field, where the Earl of Arran was with his friends,
      the said John Knox being with him, to bear witness and testification of the end of<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_252">252</span>      the agreement. As the Earl Bothwell entered at the chamber door, and would have done those honours that friends had
      appointed (Master Gavin Hamilton and the Laird of Riccarton were the chief friends that communed) the Earl of Arran
      gently passed to him, embraced him, and said, "If the hearts be upright, few ceremonies may serve and content me."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p86" shownumber="no">The said John Knox, in audience of them both and of their friends, then said, "Now, my Lords, God hath brought you together
      by the labours of simple men, in respect of such as would have travailed therein. I know my labours are already taken
      in an evil part; but, because I have the testimony of a good conscience before my God that whatsoever I have done,
      I have done in His fear, for the profit of you both, for the hurt of none, and for the tranquillity of this realm:
      seeing, I say, that my conscience beareth witness to me—a witness that I have sought and continually seek—I the more
      patiently bear the misreports and wrongous judgments of men. And now I leave you in peace, and desire you that are
      the friends to study that amity may increase, all former offences being forgotten." The friends of either part embraced
      the others, and the two Earls departed to a window, and talked by themselves familiarly for a reasonable space. Thereafter
      the Earl Bothwell departed for that night; and upon the next day in the morning he returned, with some of his honest
      friends, and came to the sermon with the Earl foresaid. At this many rejoiced. But God had another work to work than
      the eyes of men could espy.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p86.1">The Earl of Arran suspects Treachery.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p87" shownumber="no">The next Thursday, the 26th of March 1562, they dined together; and thereafter the said Earl Bothwell and Master Gavin Hamilton
      rode to my Lord Duke's Grace, who then was at Kinneil. What communication was had betwixt them, it is not certainly
      known, except by the report which the said Earl of Arran made to the Queen's Grace, and to the Earl of Moray, by his
      writings. For upon Friday, the fourth day after their reconciliation, the sermon being ended, the said Earl of Arran
      came to the house of John Knox, and brought with him Master Richard Strang and Alexander Guthrie. To them he opened
      the grief of his<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_253">253</span> mind before John Knox was called; for he was occupied,
      as he is wont to be after his sermons, in directing of writings.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p88" shownumber="no">These labours ended, the said Earl called the three together, and said, "I am treasonably betrayed;" and with these words
      began to weep. John Knox demanded, "My Lord, who has betrayed you?" "One Judas, or other," said he; "but I know it
      is but my life that is sought: I regard it not." The other said, "My Lord, I understand not such dark manner of speaking:
      if I shall give you any answer, you must speak more plain." "Well," said he, "I take you three to witness that I open
      this to you, and I will write it to the Queen. An act of treason is laid to my charge; the Earl of Bothwell has shown
      to me in counsel that he shall take the Queen and put her in my hands in the Castle of Dumbarton; and that he shall
      slay the Earl of Moray, Lethington, and others that now misguide her: and so shall I and he rule all. But I know that
      this is devised to accuse me of treason; for I know that he will inform the Queen of it. But I take you to witness
      that I open it here to you; and, incontinently, I will go and write to the Queen's Majesty, and to my brother, the
      Earl of Moray."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p89" shownumber="no">John Knox demanded, "Did ye consent, my Lord, to any part of that treason?" He answered, "Nay." "Then," said he, "in my judgment,
      his words, albeit they were spoken, can never be treason to you; for the performance of the act depends upon your will,
      whereto ye say ye have dissented; and so shall that purpose vanish and die by itself, unless ye waken it; for it is
      not to be supposed that he will accuse you of that which he himself devised, and whereto ye would not consent." "O,"
      said he, "ye understand not what craft is used against me: it is treason to conceal treason." "My Lord," said he, "treason
      must import consent and determination, which I hear upon neither of your parts. Therefore, my Lord, in my judgment,
      it shall be more sure and more honourable to you to depend upon your innocence, and to abide the unjust accusation
      of another, if any follow thereof, as I think there shall not, than for you to accuse, especially after so recent reconciliation,
      and have none other witnesses but your own affirmation." "I know," said he, "that he will offer combat to me; but that
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_254">254</span> would not be suffered in France: I will do that which I have purposed."
      And so he departed, and took with him to his lodging the said Alexander Guthrie and Mr. Richard Strang. Thence was
      dated and written a letter to the Queen's Majesty, according to the former purpose, which letter was directed with
      all diligence to the Queen's Majesty, who was then in Falkland.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p90" shownumber="no">The Earl himself rode afterwards to Kinneil, to his father, the Duke's Grace. How he was treated, we have but the common
      bruit; but thence he wrote another letter with his own hand, in cipher, to the Earl of Moray, complaining of his rigorous
      handling and treatment by his own father, and by his friends; and affirming, farther, that he feared his life, in case
      he gat not speedy rescue. He did not rest there, but brake the chamber wherein he was put, and with great pain passed
      to Stirling, and thence he was convoyed to the Hallyards. There he was kept until the Earl of Moray came to him, and
      convoyed him to the Queen, who was then in Falkland. She was sufficiently instructed concerning the whole matter; and,
      upon suspicion conceived, had ordered the apprehension of Master Gavin Hamilton and the Earl Bothwell. They, knowing
      nothing of what had passed, came to Falkland, and this augmented the former suspicion.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p90.1">The frenzy of the Earl of Arran.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p91" shownumber="no">The letters of John Knox, however, ensured that all things were done the more circumspectly; for he did plainly forewarn
      the Earl of Moray that he espied the Earl of Arran to be stricken with frenzy, and therefore would not have too great
      credit given to his words and inventions. And so it came to pass; for within few days the Earl's sickness increased;
      he devised of wondrous signs that he saw in the heaven; and, finally, he behaved himself in all things so foolishly
      that his frenzy could not be hid. Nevertheless, the Earl Bothwell and the Abbot of Kilwinning were detained in the
      Castle of St. Andrews, and convened before the Council, with the Earl of Arran, who ever stood firm in alleging that
      the Earl Bothwell proponed to him such things as he had advertised the Queen's Grace of. He stiffly denied that his
      father, the said Abbot, or his friends, knew anything of the matter, or that they intended any violence<span class="pb"
            id="iii.iv-Page_255">255</span> against him; and alleged that he had been enchanted so to think and write. Thereat
      the Queen, highly offended, committed him to prison with the other two, first in the Castle of St. Andrews, and thereafter
      in the Castle of Edinburgh....

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p92" shownumber="no">Things put in order in Fife, the Queen returned to Edinburgh, and then began dancing to grow hot; for her friends began to
      triumph in France. Sure information of this came to the ears of John Knox, for there were some that showed to him the
      state of things from time to time. He was assured that the Queen had danced excessively until after midnight, because
      she had received letters informing her that persecution was renewed in France, and that her uncles were beginning to
      stir their tail, and to trouble the whole realm of France. Upon occasion of this text, "And now understand, O ye kings,
      and be learned, ye that judge the earth," he began to tax the ignorance, the vanity, and the despite of princes against
      all virtue, and against all those in whom hatred of vice and love of virtue appeared.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p92.1">He is summoned before the Queen.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p93" shownumber="no">Report of this sermon was made unto the Queen, and John Knox was sent for. Mr. Alexander Cockburn, of Ormiston, who had formerly
      been his scholar, and then was very familiar with him, was the messenger, and gave him some knowledge both of the report
      and of the reporters. The Queen was in her bedchamber, and with her, besides the ladies and the common servants, were
      the Lord James, the Earl Morton, Secretary Lethington, and some of the guard that had made the report. He was called,
      and accused of having spoken irreverently of the Queen, of travailing to bring her into the hatred and contempt of
      the people, and of exceeding the bounds of his text. Upon these three heads, the Queen herself made a long harangue
      or oration; to which the said John answered as follows:—
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p93.1">John Knox, states his Views concerning the Behaviour of Princes.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p94" shownumber="no">"Madam, this is oftentimes the just recompense which God giveth to the stubborn of the world. Because they will not hear
      God speaking for the comfort of the penitent, and the amendment of the wicked, they are oft compelled to hear the false
      report of others to their greater displeasure. I doubt not but that it<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_256">256</span>      came to the ears of proud Herod that our Master Christ Jesus called him fox; but they told him not how odious a thing
      it was before God to murder an innocent, as he had lately done before, causing John the Baptist to be beheaded, to
      reward the dancing of a harlot's daughter. Madam, if the reporters of my words had been honest men, they would have
      reported my words, and the circumstances of the same. But, because they would have credit in Court, and lack virtue
      worthy thereof, they must have somewhat to please your Majesty, if it were but flattery and lies. If your Grace take
      any pleasure in such persons, it will turn to your everlasting displeasure. Madam, had your own ears heard the whole
      matter that I entreated, ye could not justly have been offended with anything that I spake, if there be in you any
      sparkle of the Spirit of God, yea, of honesty or wisdom. Ye have heard their report; may it please your Grace to hear
      myself rehearse the sermon, as nearly as memory will serve.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p95" shownumber="no">"My text, Madam, was this, 'And now, O kings, understand; be learned, ye judges of the earth.' After, Madam, I had declared
      the dignity of kings and rulers, the honour in which God has placed them, and the obedience that is due unto them,
      as God's lieutenants, I demanded this: But, O alas! what account shall the most part of princes make before that Supreme
      Judge, whose throne and authority so manifestly and shamefully they abuse? This day is most true the complaint of Solomon
      that violence and oppression do occupy the throne of God here in this earth: murderers, bloodthirsty men, oppressors,
      and malefactors dare be bold to present themselves before kings and princes, and the poor saints of God are banished
      and exiled. What shall we say, but that the Devil hath taken possession of the throne of God, which ought to be fearful
      to all wicked doers, and a refuge to the innocent oppressed. How can it be otherwise? Princes will not understand;
      they will not be taught as God commands them. God's law they despise, His statutes and holy ordinances they will not
      understand; they are more exercised in fiddling and flinging than in reading or hearing God's most blessed Word; and
      fiddlers and flatterers, who commonly corrupt youth, are<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_257">257</span> more precious
      in their eyes than are men of wisdom and gravity, who might, by wholesome admonition, beat down in them some part of
      that vanity and pride wherein all are born, but in princes taketh deep root and strength by wicked education.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p95.1">Of Dancing.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p96" shownumber="no">"Of dancing, Madam, I said that, albeit in the Scriptures I found no praise of it, and in profane writers that it is termed
      the gesture rather of those that are mad and in frenzy than of sober men; yet do I not utterly condemn it, providing
      that two vices be avoided. Firstly, the principal vocation of those that use that exercise must not be neglected for
      the pleasure of dancing; secondly, they may not dance, as did the Philistines their fathers, for the pleasure that
      they take in the displeasure of God's people. If they do either, they shall receive the reward of dancers, and that
      will be drink in hell, unless they speedily repent, and so shall God turn their mirth into sudden sorrow. God will
      not always afflict His people, nor will He always wink at the tyranny of tyrants. If any man, Madam, will say that
      I spake more, let him presently accuse me; for I think I have not only touched the sum, but the very words as I spake
      them." Many that stood by bare witness with him that he had recited the very words that he had spoken publicly.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p97" shownumber="no">The Queen looked about to some of the reporters, and said, "Your words are sharp enough as ye have spoken them; but yet they
      were told to me in another manner. I know that my uncles and ye are not of one religion, and therefore I cannot blame
      you, albeit you have no good opinion of them. But if ye hear anything of myself that mislikes you, come to myself and
      tell me, and I shall hear you."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p98" shownumber="no">"Madam," quoth he, "I am assured that your uncles are enemies to God, and unto His Son, Jesus Christ; and that, for maintenance
      of their own pomp and worldly glory, they spare not to spill the blood of many innocents. I am therefore assured that
      their enterprises shall have no better success than have had others that before them have done what they do now. But
      as to your own personage, Madam, I would be<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_258">258</span> glad to do all that I could
      for your Grace's contentment, provided that I exceed not the bounds of my vocation. I am called, Madam, to a public
      function within the Kirk of God, and am appointed by God to rebuke the sins and vices of all. I am not appointed to
      come to every man in particular to show him his offence; that labour were infinite. If your Grace will please to frequent
      the public sermons, I doubt not but that ye shall fully understand both what I like and mislike, as well in your Majesty
      as in all others. Or, if your Grace will assign unto me a certain day and hour when it will please you to hear the
      form and substance of doctrine which is proponed in public to the churches of this realm, I will most gladly await
      upon your Grace's pleasure, time, and place. But to wait upon your chamber door, or elsewhere, and then to have no
      farther liberty than to whisper my mind in your Grace's ear, or to tell you what others think and speak of you, neither
      will my conscience nor the vocation whereto God hath called me suffer it. For, albeit at your Grace's commandment I
      am here now, I cannot tell what other men shall judge of me, when they learn that at this time of day I am absent from

<p id="iii.iv-p99" shownumber="no">"You will not always," said she, "be at your book," and so turned her back. John Knox departed with a reasonably merry countenance.
      Some Papists, offended at this, said, "He is not afraid." Hearing this, he answered, "Why should the pleasing face
      of a gentlewoman affright me? I have looked in the faces of many angry men, and yet have not been afraid, above measure."
      And so left he the Queen and the Court for that time.

      and posts ran very frequently. There was great bruit of an interview and meeting of the two Queens at York, and some
      preparations were made for this in both the realms. But it failed upon the part of England, and that by occasion of
      the troubles moved in France, as was alleged. These caused the Queen and her Council to remain in the south parts of

      His entertainment was honourable; but our Queen liked not his petition. Such a man was too base for her estate; had

<p id="iii.iv-p104" shownumber="no">At the Assembly of the Kirk at Midsummer, on the 29th of June 1562, many notable points were discussed concerning good order
      in the Church; for the Papists and the idolatry of the Queen began to trouble the former good orders.... The tenor
      of the supplication read in open audience, and approved by the whole Assembly to be presented to the Queen's Majesty,
      was this:—
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p104.1">The Supplication presented to the Queen.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p105" shownumber="no">"Having in mind that fearful sentence, pronounced by the Eternal God against the watchmen that see the sword of God's punishment
      approach, and do not in plain words forewarn the people, yea, the princes and rulers, that they may repent, we cannot
      but signify unto your Highness, and unto your Council, that the state of this realm is such, at this present time,
      that unless redress and remedy be shortly provided, God's hand cannot long spare in His anger, to strike the head and
      the tail; the inobedient prince and sinful people. For, as God is unchangeable and true, so must He punish in these
      our days the grievous sins<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_260">260</span> that we read He has punished in all ages,
      after He has long called for repentance, and none is shown.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p106" shownumber="no">"That your Grace and Council may understand what be the things we desire to be reformed, we will begin at that which we assuredly
      know to be the fountain and spring of all other evils that now abound in this realm, to wit, that idol and bastard
      service of God, the Mass; the fountain, we call it, of all impiety, not only because many take boldness to sin by reason
      of the opinion which they have conceived of that idol, to wit, that by the virtue of it, they get remission of their
      sins; but also that, under colour of the Mass, whores, adulterers, drunkards, blasphemers of God and of His holy Word
      and Sacraments, and such other manifest malefactors, are maintained and defended: for, let any Mass-sayer, or earnest
      maintainer thereof, be deprehended in any of the forenamed crimes, no execution can be had, for all is said to be done
      in hatred of his religion; and so are wicked men permitted to live wickedly, cloaked and protected by that odious idol.
      But, supposing the Mass were occasion of no such evils, yet in itself it is so odious in God's presence that we cannot
      cease, with all instance, to desire the removing of the same, as well from yourself as from all others within this
      realm, taking heaven and earth, yea, and your own conscience, to record that the obstinate maintenance of that idol
      shall in the end be to you destruction of soul and body.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p107" shownumber="no">"If your Majesty demand why we are more earnest now than we have been heretofore; we answer (our former silence nowise excused)
      that it is because we find ourselves frustrated of our hope and expectation; which was that, in process of time, your
      Grace's heart should have been mollified, so far as to have heard the public doctrine taught within this realm; by
      which, our farther hope was, God's Holy Spirit should so have moved your heart, that ye should have suffered your religion,
      which before God is nothing but abomination and vanity, to have been tried by the true touchstone, the written Word
      of God; and that your Grace finding it to have no ground or foundation in the same, should have given such glory unto
      God that ye would have preferred His truth unto<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_261">261</span> your own preconceived
      vain opinion, of whatever antiquity it has been. Of this we in a part are now discouraged and can no longer keep silence,
      unless we would make ourselves criminal before God of your blood, perishing in your own iniquities; for we plainly
      admonish you of the dangers to come.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p108" shownumber="no">"The second that we require is punishment of horrible vices, such as are adultery, fornication, open whoredom, blasphemy,
      and contempt of God, of His Word and of His Sacraments; vices which, in this realm, for lack of punishment, do even
      now so abound that sin is reputed to be no sin. And, therefore, as we see the present signs of God's wrath manifestly
      appear, so do we forewarn that He will strike, before long, if His law be permitted thus manifestly to be contemned,
      without punishment. If any object, that punishment cannot be commanded to be executed without a Parliament; we answer
      that the Eternal God in His Parliament has pronounced death to be the punishment for adultery and for blasphemy. If
      ye put not His acts to execution, seeing that kings are but His lieutenants, having no power to give life where He
      commands death, He will repute you, and all others that foster vice, patrons of impiety, and He will not fail to punish
      you for neglecting His judgments.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p109" shownumber="no">"Our third request concerneth the poor, who be of three sorts; the poor labourers of the ground; the poor desolate beggars,
      orphans, widows, and strangers; and the poor ministers of the holy Evangel of Christ Jesus, who are all so cruelly
      treated by this last pretended order taken for sustentation of ministers, that their latter misery far surmounteth
      the former. For now the poor labourers of the ground are so oppressed by the cruelty of those that pay their Third,
      that they for the most part advance upon the poor, whatsoever they pay to the Queen, or to any other. As for the very
      indigent and poor, to whom God commands a sustentation to be provided from the teinds, they are so despised that it
      is a wonder that the sun giveth light and heat to the earth, where God's name is so frequently called upon, and no
      mercy, according to His commandment, is shown to His creatures. And also for the ministers, their<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_262">262</span>      livings are so appointed that the most part shall live but a beggar's life. And all cometh of impiety, that the idle
      bellies of Christ's enemies must be fed with their former delicacies.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p110" shownumber="no">"We dare not conceal from your Grace and Honours the burden of our conscience, which is this, that neither by the law of
      God, nor by any just law of man, is anything due to them who now most cruelly do exact of the poor and rich the Two-part
      of their benefices, as they call it.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p111" shownumber="no">"Therefore we most humbly require that some other order may be taken with them, and that they be not set up again to empire
      above the people of God, or above any subject within this realm. For we fear that such usurpation to their former estate
      shall be in the end neither pleasing to themselves, nor profitable to them that would place them in that tyranny. If
      any think that a competent living should be assigned to them, we repugn not, provided that the labourers of the ground
      be not oppressed, the poor be not utterly neglected, the ministers of the Word be not so sharply treated as they now
      are, and, finally, that those idle bellies, who by law can crave nothing, shall confess that they receive their sustentation,
      not as a matter of debt, but as of benevolence. Our humble request is, therefore, that some speedy order may be taken
      that the poor labourers may find some relief, and that in every parish some portion of the teinds may be assigned to
      the sustentation of the poor within the same; and likewise that some public relief may be provided for the poor within
      burghs; that collectors may be appointed to gather, and that sharp account may be taken, as well of their receipts
      as of their disbursements. The farther consideration to be had towards our ministers, we in some part remit to your
      wisdoms, and to their particular complaints.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p112" shownumber="no">"Our fourth petition is for the manses, yards, and glebes, justly appertaining to the ministers, without which it is impossible
      for them quietly to serve their charges; and therefore we desire order to be taken therein without delay.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p113" shownumber="no">"Our fifth concerneth the inobedience of certain wicked persons, who not only trouble, and have troubled ministers in their
      functions, but also disobey the superintendents in their<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_263">263</span> visitation.
      Of this we humbly crave remedy; not so much for any fear that we and our ministers have of the Papists, but for the
      love that we bear to the common tranquillity. For we cannot hide from your Majesty and Council that, if the Papists
      think to triumph where they may, and to do what they list, where there is not a party able to resist them, some will
      think that they must begin where they left off. Heretofore they have borne all things patiently, in hope that laws
      should have bridled the wicked. If they be frustrated in this, albeit nothing is more odious to them than tumults and
      domestic discord, men will attempt the uttermost, before they behold with their own eyes the demolition of that House
      of God, which with travail and danger God hath within this realm erected by them.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p114" shownumber="no">"Lastly, we desire that such as have received remission of their Third be compelled to sustain the ministry within their
      bounds, else we forewarn your Grace and Council that we fear that the people will retain the whole in their hands,
      until such time as their ministry shall be sufficiently provided. We farther desire that the kirks be repaired according
      to an Act set forth by the Lords of Secret Council, before your Majesty's arrival in this country; that judges be appointed
      to hear the causes of divorcement, for the Kirk can no longer sustain that burden, especially since there is no punishment
      for the offenders; that sayers and hearers of Mass, profaners of the Sacraments, such as have entered into benefices
      by the Pope's bulls, and other such transgressors of the law made at your Grace's arrival within this realm, may be
      severely punished; else men will think that there is no truth meant in the making of such laws.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p115" shownumber="no">"Farther, we most humbly desire of your Grace and honourable Council a resolute answer to every one of the heads forewritten,
      that, the same being known, we may somewhat satisfy such as are grievously offended at manifest iniquity now maintained,
      at oppression under pretext of law done against the poor, and at the rebellious disobedience of many wicked persons
      against God's Word and holy ordinance.

</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p116.2">Secretary Lethington objects to the Terms of the Supplication.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p117" shownumber="no">These things were read in public Assembly, and approved by all. Some wished that more sharpness had been used, because the
      time so craved. But the monsieurs of the Court, and Secretary Lethington above others, could not abide such hard speaking;
      "For who ever saw it written," said he, "to a prince, that God would strike the head and the tail, or that, if Papists
      did what they should list, men would begin where they had left off?" Above all others, it was most offensive that the
      Queen was accused as if she would raise up Papists and Papistry again. To put that into the people's head was no less
      than treason; for oaths durst be made that she never meant such a thing.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p118" shownumber="no">It was answered that the Prophet Isaiah used such manner of speaking; and there was no doubt but that he was well acquainted
      in the Court, for it was supposed that he was of the King's stock. Howsoever it was, his words make manifest that he
      spake to the Court and courtiers, to judges, ladies, princes and priests. And yet, says he, "The Lord shall cut away
      the head and the tail," etc. "And so," said the first writer, "I find that such a phrase was used once before. If it
      offend you that we say, 'Men must begin where they left off,' in case the Papists do as they do; we would desire you
      to teach us, not so much how we shall speak, but rather what we shall do when our ministers are stricken, our superintendents
      are disobeyed, and a plain rebellion is decreed against all good order."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p119" shownumber="no">"Complain," said Lethington. "Whom to?" said the other. "To the Queen's Majesty," said he. "How long shall we do so?" quoth
      the whole. "Till ye get remedy," said the Justice Clerk: "give me their names, and I shall<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_265">265</span>      give you letters." "If the sheep," said one, "shall complain to the wolf that the wolves and whelps have devoured their
      lambs, the complainer may stand in danger; but the offender, we fear, shall have liberty to hunt after his prey." "Such
      comparisons," said Lethington, "are very unsavoury; for I am assured that the Queen will neither erect nor yet maintain
      Papistry." "Let your assurance," said another, "serve yourself; it cannot assure us; for her manifest proceedings speak
      the contrary."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p120" shownumber="no">After such taunting reasoning on both sides, the multitude concluded that the supplication, as it was conceived, should be
      presented; unless the Secretary would form one more agreeable to the present necessity. He promised to keep the substance
      of ours, but said he would use other terms, and ask things in a more genteel manner. The first writer answered that
      he served the Kirk at their commandment, and was content that with his dictament men should use the liberty that best
      pleased them, provided that he was not compelled to subscribe to the flattery of such as regarded the persons of men
      and women more than the simple truth of God. So this former supplication was given to be reformed as Lethington's wisdom
      thought best. And in very deed he so framed it that, when it was delivered by the Superintendents of Lothian and Fife,
      and when the Queen had read somewhat of it, she said, "Here are many fair words: I cannot tell what the hearts are."
      For our painted oratory, we were termed the next name to flatterers and dissemblers; but, for that session, the Kirk
      received no other answer....

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p120.1">The Queen visits the North: Papist Intrigues.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p121" shownumber="no">The interview and meeting of the two Queens being delayed until the next year, our Sovereign took purpose to visit the north,
      and departed from Stirling in the month of August. Whether there was any secret paction and confederacy betwixt the
      Papists in the south and the Earl of Huntly and his Papists in the north; or, to speak more plainly, betwixt the Queen
      herself and Huntly, we cannot certainly say. But the suspicions were wondrously vehement that there was no good-will
      borne to the Earl of Moray, nor yet to such as depended upon him<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_266">266</span> at
      that time. The history we shall faithfully declare, and leave the judgment to the reader....
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p122" shownumber="no">The Queen and Court remained at Aberdeen certain days, to deliberate upon the affairs of the country; and some began to smell
      that the Earl of Huntly was under gathering.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p122.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p122.1">205</a></sup>

      on the 28th of August. Some say that he broke the stanchions of the window; others whispered that he got easy passage
      by the gates. One thing is certain; the Queen was little offended at his escaping. The said Earl showed himself not
      very much afraid, for his common residence was in Lothian. The Archbishop of St. Andrews and Abbot of Crossraguel kept
      secret convention at that same time in Paisley, and to them resorted divers Papists; yea, the said Archbishop spake
      with the Duke, and unto him came also the Lord Gordon from the Earl of Huntly, requiring him "to put to his hands in
      the south, as he should do in the north; and Knox's crying or preaching should not stay that purpose." The Archbishop,
      let him be never so close, could not altogether hide his mind, but at his own table said, "The Queen is gone into the
      north, belike to seek disobedience: she may perchance find the thing that she seeks." It was constantly affirmed that
      the Earl Bothwell and the said Lord Gordon spake together, but of their purpose we heard no mention.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p122.2">John Knox warns the Protestants.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p123" shownumber="no">The same year, and at that instant time, Commissioners were appointed by the General Assembly. To Carrick and Cunningham,
      Master George Hay was sent, and he, for the space of a month, preached with great fruit in all the churches of Carrick.
      To Kyle, and to the parts of Galloway, John Knox was appointed. Besides showing the doctrine of the Evangel to the
      common people, John Knox forewarned some of the nobility and Barons of the dangers that he feared, and that were apparently
      to follow shortly; and he exhorted them to put themselves in order, so that they might be able to serve the authority,
      and yet not to suffer the enemies of God's truth to have the upper hand. Thereupon, a great part of the Barons and
      Gentlemen
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_267">267</span> of Kyle and Cunningham and Carrick, professing the true doctrine of
      the Evangel, assembled at Ayr.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p123.1">A Bond is again subscribed.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p124" shownumber="no">After exhortations made and conference held, these subscribed a bond to maintain and assist the preaching of God's holy Evangel,
      then, of His mere mercy, offered to this realm; and also the ministers thereof against all persons, power, and authority,
      that would oppose themselves to the doctrine proponed, and by them received. And farther, with the same solemnity,
      it was protested and promised, that every one should assist others, yea, the whole body of the Protestants within the
      realm, in all lawful and just actions, against all persons; so that whosoever should hurt, molest, or trouble any of
      our body, should be reputed enemy to the whole, unless the offender were content to submit himself to the judgment
      of the Kirk, as established amongst us....

<p id="iii.iv-p125" shownumber="no">These things done at Ayr, the said John passed to Nithsdale and Galloway, and there, in conference with the Master of Maxwell,
      a man of great judgment and experience, he communicated such things as he feared. Upon his suggestion, the Master wrote
      to the Earl Bothwell, enjoining him to behave himself as became a faithful subject, and to keep good quietness in the
      parts committed to his charge, for so would the crime of his breaking ward be the more easily pardoned. John Knox wrote
      to the Duke's Grace, and earnestly exhorted him neither to give ear to the Archbishop, his bastard brother, nor yet
      to the persuasion of the Earl of Huntly; for if he did, he assured him, he and his house should come to a sudden ruin.

      fearful bruits that they sparsed abroad, sometimes that the Queen was taken; sometimes that the Earl of Moray and all
      his band were slain; and sometimes that the Queen had given herself to the Earl of Huntly,—besides such bruits, the
      Archbishop, to<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_268">268</span> disturb the country of Kyle, where quietness was greatest,
      raised the Crawfords against the Reids for payment of the Archbishop's Pasch fines; but that was stayed by the labours

      to him, and debate was held in Maybole during three days. The Abbot had the advantage that he required; to wit, he
      took upon him to prove that Melchisedec offered bread and wine to God, and this was the ground upon which was founded
      the argument that the Mass was a sacrifice, etc. But, in the travail of three days, no proof could be produced for
      Melchisedec's oblation, as in the disputation (which is to be had in print) may clearly appear. The Papists constantly
      looked for a wolter,

      that she would not go to Strathbogie, but passed through Strathisla to Inverness, where the Castle was denied to her.
      The captain had command to keep it, and looked<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_269">269</span> for relief which John

      of Scottish grey hose, and a covering of arras-work, she said, "What stability shall we judge to be in this world:
      there lieth he that yesterday morning was holden the wisest, the richest, and a man of greatest power within Scotland."
      In very deed, she lied not; for, in man's opinion, under a prince, there was not such a one produced in this realm

      to convene with them, to give thanks to God for His notable deliverance. She gloomed at the messenger and at the request,
      and scarcely would give a good word or blithe countenance to any that she knew to be earnest favourers of the Earl
      Moray, whose prosperity was, and yet is, to her boldened heart, a very venom against him for his godliness and upright
      plainness. For many days she bare no better countenance; and thereby it might have been evidently espied that she rejoiced
      not greatly in the success of that matter; and, albeit she caused John Gordon and divers others to be executed, it
      was the destruction of others that she sought.

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p132" shownumber="no">In the meantime, there was much trouble in France; and the intelligence and outward familiarity betwixt the two Queens was
      great. Lethington was directed with large commission both to the Queen of England and to the Guisians. The marriage
      of our Queen was in every man's mouth. Some would have Spain; some the Emperor's brother; some Lord Robert Dudley;
      some the Duke de Nemours; and some unhappily guessed at the Lord Darnley. We know not what Lethington's credit was;
      but, shortly after, there began to be much talk of the Earl of Lennox, and of his son, the Lord Darnley. It was said
      that Lethington spake with the Lady Margaret Douglas, and that Robert Melvin received a horse, for the Secretary's
      use, from the Earl of Lennox or from his wife. Howsoever it was, Master Fowler, servant to the said Earl, came with
      letters to the Queen's Grace, and licence was permitted to the Earl of Lennox to come to Scotland, to travail in his
      lawful business. On the day that the licence was granted, the Secretary said, "This day have I incurred the deadly
      hatred of all the Hamiltons within Scotland, and have done them no less displeasure than had I cutted their throats."

<p id="iii.iv-p133" shownumber="no">The Earl Bothwell, who had broken ward, fearing apprehension, prepared to pass to France; but, by storm of weather, he was
      driven into England, where he was stayed, and the Queen of England offered to surrender him. But our Queen answered
      that he was no rebel, and requested that he should have liberty to pass whither it pleased him. In this, Lethington
      helped not a little; for he travailed to have friends in every faction of the Court. Thus the said Earl obtained licence
      to pass to France.

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p134" shownumber="no">The Court remained for the most part in Edinburgh, during the winter after the death of the Earl of Huntly. The preachers
      were wondrously vehement in reprehension of all manner of vice, which then began to abound; and especially avarice,
      oppression of the poor, excess, riotous cheer, banqueting, immoderate dancing, and the whoredom that ensues. The courtiers
      began to storm, and to pick quarrels against the preachers, alleging that all their preaching was turned to railing.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p135" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_271">271</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p136" shownumber="no">One of them gave answer as follows: "It comes to our ears that we are called railers. Albeit we wonder, we are not ashamed.
      The most worthy servants of God that before us have travailed in this vocation have so been styled. But the same God,
      who from the beginning has punished the contempt of His Word, and has poured forth His vengeance upon such proud mockers,
      shall not spare you; yea, He shall not spare you before the eyes of this same wicked generation, for whose pleasure
      ye despise all wholesome admonitions.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p137" shownumber="no">"Have ye not seen a greater than any of you sitting where presently ye sit, pick his nails and pull down his bonnet over
      his eyes, when idolatry, witchcraft, murder, oppression, and such vices were rebuked? Was not his common talk, 'When
      these knaves have railed their fill, will they then hold their peace?' Have ye not heard it affirmed to his own face
      that God should revenge his blasphemy, even in the eyes of such as were witnesses to his iniquity? Then was the Earl
      of Huntly accused by you as the maintainer of idolatry, and the only hinderer of all good order. Him has God punished,
      even according to the threatenings that his and your ears heard; and by your hands hath God executed His judgments.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p138" shownumber="no">"But what amendment in any case can be espied in you? Idolatry was never in greater rest: virtue and virtuous men were never
      in more contempt: vice was never more bold, never did it less fear punishment. And yet, who guides the Queen and Court?
      Who but the Protestants? O horrible slanderers of God, and of His holy Evangel. Better it were for you plainly to renounce
      Christ Jesus, than thus to expose His blessed Evangel to mockage. If God do not punish you, so that this same age shall
      see and behold your punishment, the Spirit of righteous judgment guides me not."...

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p138.1">The General Assembly: 25th December 1562.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p139" shownumber="no">At the General Assembly of the Church, holden the twenty-fifth of December, the year of God 1562, great complaints were made
      that churches lacked ministers; that ministers lacked their stipends; that wicked men were permitted to be schoolmasters,
      and so to infect the youth. One, Master Robert Cumin,<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_272">272</span> schoolmaster
      in Arbroath, was complained upon by the Laird of Dun, and sentence was pronounced against him. It was farther complained
      that idolatry was erected in divers parts of the realm; and some thought that new supplication for redress should be
      presented to the Queen's Grace. Others demanded, What answer was received on the former occasion? The Superintendent
      of Lothian confessed the deliverance of it. "But," said he, "I received no answer." It was answered on behalf of the
      Queen—for her supporters were ever there—that it was well known to the whole realm what troubles had occurred since
      the last Assembly; and, therefore, that they should not wonder that the Queen had not answered: but they doubted not
      but that order would be taken betwixt that and the Parliament which was appointed for May, and all men should have
      occasion to stand content. This satisfied the whole Assembly for that time. And this was the practice of the Queen
      and of her Council to drive time with fair words....
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p139.1">The Protestants deal with Idolaters and the Mass.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p140" shownumber="no">The Papists, at Easter, 1563, had erected that idol, the Mass, in divers parts of the realm; amongst these being the Archbishop
      of St. Andrews, the Prior of Whithorn, with divers others of their faction.... The brethren, universally offended,
      and espying that the Queen did but mock them by her proclamations, determined to put to their own hands, and to punish
      for example to others. So some priests in the West-land were apprehended, and intimation was made by the brethren to
      others, as to the Abbot of Crossraguel, the Parson of Sanquhar, and such, that they should not proceed by complaint
      to Queen or Council, but should execute the punishment that God, in His Law, had appointed to idolaters, by such means
      as they might, wherever these should be apprehended.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p141" shownumber="no">The Queen stormed at such freedom of speaking, but she could not amend it; for the spirit of God, of boldness, and of wisdom,
      had not then left the most part of those whom God had used as instruments in the beginning. They were of one mind to
      maintain the truth of God, and to suppress idolatry. Particularities had not divided them; and therefore could not
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_273">273</span> the Devil, working in the Queen and Papists, then do what he would.
</p>
<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p141.1">Queen Mary and John Knox at Lochleven.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p142" shownumber="no">The Queen began to invent a new craft. She sent for John Knox to come to her at Lochleven. She travailed with him earnestly
      for two hours before her supper, seeking that he would be the instrument to persuade the people, and principally the
      gentlemen of the West, not to put hands to punish men for conducting themselves in their religion as pleased them.
      The other, perceiving her craft, said that if her Grace would punish the malefactors according to the laws, he could
      promise quietness upon the part of all them that professed the Lord Jesus within Scotland. But, if her Majesty thought
      to delude the laws, he said he feared that some would let the Papists understand that they should not be suffered to
      offend God's Majesty so manifestly, without punishment.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p143" shownumber="no">"Will ye," quoth she, "allow that they shall take <em id="iii.iv-p143.1">my</em> sword in their hand?"
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p144" shownumber="no">"The sword of justice," quoth he, "Madam, is God's, and is given to princes and rulers for an end. If they transgress this,
      sparing the wicked, and oppressing innocents, they that, in the fear of God, execute judgment where God has commanded,
      do not offend God, although kings forbear; nor do those sin that bridle kings from striking innocent men in their rage.
      The examples are evident; Samuel feared not to slay Agag, the fat and delicate king of Amalek, whom King Saul had saved....
      And so, Madam, your Grace may see that others than chief magistrates may lawfully punish, and have punished the vice
      and crimes that God commands to be punished. In the present case, I would earnestly pray your Majesty to take good
      advisement, and that your Grace should let the Papists understand that their attempts will not be suffered to go unpunished.
      For, by Act of Parliament, power is given to all judges to search for Mass-mongers, or the hearers of the same, within
      their own bounds, and to punish them according to the law. It shall therefore be profitable to your Majesty to consider
      what is the thing your Grace's subjects look to receive of your Majesty, and what it is that ye ought to do to them
      by mutual<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_274">274</span> contract. They are only bound to obey you in God. Ye are
      bound to keep laws for them. Ye crave of them service; they crave of you protection and defence against wicked doers.
      Now, Madam, if ye shall deny your duty to those who especially crave that ye shall punish malefactors, think ye to
      receive full obedience of them? I fear, Madam, ye shall not."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p145" shownumber="no">Herewith the Queen, being somewhat offended, passed to her supper. John Knox left her, informed the Earl of Moray of the
      whole reasoning, and departed, of final purpose to return to Edinburgh, without any further communication with the
      Queen.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p146" shownumber="no">But before sunrise, upon the morrow, two messengers were directed to him, commanding him not to depart until he spake with
      the Queen's Majesty. This he did, meeting her at the hawking be-west Kinross. Whether it was the night's sleep or a
      deep dissimulation locked in her breast that made her forget her former anger, wise men may doubt; but concerning that
      she never moved word, and began divers other purposes, such as the offering of a ring to her by the Lord Ruthven.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p147" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> I cannot love Lord Ruthven, for I know him to use enchantment, and yet is he one of my Privy Council.

<p id="iii.iv-p148" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Whom blames your Grace for that?

<p id="iii.iv-p149" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> Lethington was the whole cause.

<p id="iii.iv-p151" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> I understand that ye are appointed to go to Dumfries, for the election of a Superintendent to be established

</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p153" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> But I hear that the Bishop of Athens would be Superintendent.

<p id="iii.iv-p154" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> He is one, Madam, that is put in election.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p155" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> If ye knew him as well as I do, ye would never promote him to that office, nor yet to any other within your

</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p156" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> What he has been, Madam, I neither know, nor<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_275">275</span> yet will I inquire.
      In time of darkness, what could we do but grope and go wrong even as darkness carried us? If he fear not God now, he
      deceives many more than me. And yet, Madam, I am assured that God will not suffer His Church to be so far deceived
      as that an unworthy man shall be elected, where free election is, and the Spirit of God is earnestly called upon to
      decide betwixt the two.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p157" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> Well, do as ye will, but that man is a dangerous man.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p158" shownumber="no">Therein the Queen was not deceived; for he had corrupted most part of the Gentlemen, not only to nominate him, but also to
      elect him. This perceived, the said John, Commissioner, delayed the election, and left Mr. Robert Pont (who was put
      in election with the foresaid Bishop) with the Master of Maxwell, that his doctrine and conversation might be the better
      tried by those that had not known him before. So the Bishop was frustrated of his purpose, for that time. Yet was he,
      at that time, the man that was most familiar with the said John, in his house and at table. When the Queen had talked
      long with John Knox, he being oft willing to take his leave, she said, "I have to open unto you one of the greatest
      matters that have touched me since I came to this realm, and I must have your help in it." Then she began to make a
      long discourse concerning her sister, the Lady Argyll, how that she was not so circumspect in all things as she wished
      her to be.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p159" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> Yet, my Lord, her husband, whom I love, treats her not in many things so honestly and so godly, as I think
      ye yourself would require.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p160" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Madam, I have been troubled with that matter before, and once I put such an end to it, before your Grace's arrival,
      that both she and her friends seemed fully to stand content. She herself promised before her friends that she should
      never complain to creature until I should first understand their controversy by her own mouth or an assured messenger.
      I have heard nothing from her; and, therefore, I think there is nothing but concord.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p161" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> Well, it is worse than ye believe. Do this much for my sake, as once again to put them at unity. If she
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_276">276</span> behave not herself as she ought to do, she shall find no favours of
      me. But let not my Lord know in anywise what I have requested of you in this matter; for I would be very sorry to offend
      him in that or any other thing. And now, as touching our reasoning yesternight, I promise to do as ye required. I shall
      cause all offenders to be summoned, and ye shall know that I shall minister justice.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p162" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I am assured, then, that ye shall please God, and enjoy rest and tranquillity within your realm; and that is
      more profitable to your Majesty than all the Pope's power can be.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p163" shownumber="no">And thus they parted.</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p164" shownumber="no">This conference we have inserted to let the world see how deeply Mary, Queen of Scotland, can dissemble; and how she could

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p164.1">John Knox writes to the Earl of Argyll.

<p id="iii.iv-p165" shownumber="no">John Knox departed, and prepared himself for his journey to Dumfries; and from Glasgow, according to the Queen's commandment,
      he wrote to the Earl of Argyll.... This letter was not well accepted by the said Earl; and yet he uttered no part of
      his displeasure in public, but contrarily showed himself most familiar with the said John. He kept the diet at which
      the bishop and the rest of the Papists were accused, and sat in judgment himself.

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p166" shownumber="no">The summonses were directed against the Massmongers with expedition, and in the straitest form. The nineteenth day of May
      was appointed, a day only before the Parliament. Of the Pope's knights there compeared the Archbishop of St. Andrews,
      the Prior of Whithorn, the Parson of Sanquhar, William Hamilton of Cammiskeyth, John Gordon of Barskeocht, with divers
      others. The Protestants convened to crave for justice. The Queen asked counsel of the Bishop of Ross, and of the old
      Laird of Lethington (for the younger was absent, and so the Protestants had the fewer unfriends), and they affirmed
      that she must see her laws kept, or else she would get no<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_277">277</span> obedience.

      before the Earl of Argyll, who sat in judgment; but at last he was compelled to enter within the bar. A merry man who
      now sleeps in the Lord, Robert Norwell, instead of the Bishop's cross, bare before him a steel hammer. The Archbishop
      and his band were not a little offended at this, because the bishops' privileges were not then current in Scotland,
      which day God grant our posterity may see of longer continuance than we possessed it. The Archbishop and his fellows,
      after much ado, and long drift of time, came within the Queen's will, and were committed to ward, some to one place,
      some to another. The Lady Erskine, a sweet morsel for the Devil's mouth, got the bishops for her part.

<p id="iii.iv-p167" shownumber="no">All this was done in a most deep craft, to abuse the simplicity of the Protestants, so that they should not press the Queen

      obtained of the Protestants whatsoever she desired; for thus reasoned many, "We see what the Queen has done; the like
      of this was never heard of within the realm: we will bear with the Queen; we doubt not but all shall be well." Others
      were of a contrary judgment, and forespake things as they afterwards came to pass. They said that nothing was meant
      but deceit; and that the Queen, as soon as ever Parliament was past, would set the Papists at freedom. They therefore
      urged the Nobility not to be abused. But because many had their private commodity to be handled at that Parliament,
      the common cause was the less regarded.

      so pleased the flatterers of the Earl, that they triumphed, and were glad to have gotten their occasion; for some envied
      the great familiarity that had been betwixt the said Earl and John Knox. Therefore, from the time that they once got
      that occasion to separate them, they ceased not to cast oil in the burning flame, and this ceased not to burn, until
      God, by water of affliction, began to slocken it. Lest they should seem to have altogether forsaken God (in very deed
      both God and His Word were far from the hearts of the most part of the courtiers in that age, a few excepted), they
      began a new shift. They spoke of the punishment of adultery, and of witchcraft, and to seek the restitution of the
      glebes and manses to the ministers of the Kirk, and the reparation of churches: thereby they thought to have pleased
      the godly that were highly offended at their slackness.

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p174" shownumber="no">In the progress of this corruption, and before the Parliament dissolved, John Knox, in his sermon before the most part of
      the Nobility, entered on a deep discourse concerning God's mercies to the realm, and the ingratitude which he espied
      in almost the whole multitude, albeit God had marvellously delivered them from the bondage and tyranny both of body
      and soul. "And now, my Lords," said he, "I praise my God, through Jesus Christ, that, in your own presence, I may pour
      forth the sorrows of<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_280">280</span> my heart; yea, yourselves shall be witness if
      I shall make any lie in things that are by-past. From the beginning of God's mighty working within this realm, I have
      been with you in your most desperate temptations. Ask your own consciences, and let them answer you before God, if
      I—not I, but God's Spirit by me—in your greatest extremity did not urge you ever to depend upon your God, and in His
      name promised you victory and preservation from your enemies, if ye would only depend upon His protection, and prefer
      His glory to your own lives and worldly commodity.

<p id="iii.iv-p175" shownumber="no">"I have been with you in your most extreme dangers. Perth, Cupar Moor, and the Crags of Edinburgh are yet recent in my heart.
      Yea, that dark and dolorous night, wherein ye all, my Lords, with shame and fear left this town, is yet in my mind;
      God forbid that I ever forget it. Ye yourselves yet live to testify what was my exhortation to you, and what is fallen
      in vain of all that ever God promised to you by my mouth. Not one of you, against whom death and destruction were threatened,
      perished in that danger. How many of your enemies has God plagued before your eyes! Shall this be the thankfulness
      that ye shall render unto your God, to betray His cause, when ye have it in your own hands to establish it as ye please?
      The Queen, say ye, will not agree with us. Ask of her that which by God's Word ye may justly require, and if she will
      not agree with you in God, ye are not bound to agree with her in the Devil. Let her plainly understand your minds,
      and steal not from your former stoutness in God, and He shall yet prosper you in your enterprises.

      depend, the speaker, for his treason, committed against God and against this poor commonwealth, deserves the gallows.
      Our religion, being commanded and established by God, has been accepted within this realm in public Parliament; if

<p id="iii.iv-p178" shownumber="no">These words and this manner of speaking were judged intolerable. Papists and Protestants were both offended; yea, the most
      familiar friends of Knox disdained him for that utterance. Placeboes and flatterers posted to the Court to give information
      that he had spoken against the Queen's marriage, and the Provost of Lincluden, Douglas of Drumlanrig by surname, brought
      the charge that the said John Knox should present himself before the Queen. This he did soon after dinner. The Lord
      Ochiltree, and divers of the faithful, bare him company to the Abbey; but none passed in to the Queen with him in the
      cabinet but John Erskine of Dun, then Superintendent of Angus and Mearns. The Queen, in a vehement fume, began to cry

<p id="iii.iv-p181" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> True it is, Madam, your Grace and I have been at divers controversies, in which I never perceived your Grace
      to be offended at me. But, when it shall please God to deliver you from that bondage of darkness and error in which
      ye have been nourished for the lack of true doctrine, your Majesty will find in the liberty of my tongue nothing offensive.
      Outside the preaching place, Madam, I think few have occasion to be offended at me; and there, Madam, I am not master
      of myself, but must obey Him who commands me to speak plain, and to flatter no flesh upon the face of the earth.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p182" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> But what have ye to do with my marriage?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p183" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> If it please your Majesty to hear me patiently, I shall show the truth in plain words. I grant your Grace offered
      me more than ever I required; but my answer was then, as it is now, that God hath not sent me to wait upon the courts
      of princesses, or upon the chambers of ladies. I am sent to preach the Evangel of Jesus Christ to such as please to
      hear it. It hath two parts, repentance and faith. And now, Madam, in preaching repentance, it is necessary that the
      sins of men be so noted that they may know wherein they offend; but the most part of your Nobility are so addicted
      to your affections, that neither God, His Word, nor yet their commonwealth are rightly regarded. Therefore it becomes
      me so to speak, that they may know their duty.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p184" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> What have ye to do with my marriage? Or what are ye within this commonwealth?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p185" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> A subject born within the same, Madam. And, albeit I be neither Earl, Lord, nor Baron within it, God has made
      me a profitable member within the same, however abject I be in your eyes. Yea, Madam, it appertains to me to forewarn
      of such things as may hurt that commonwealth, if I foresee them, no less than it does to any of the Nobility. Both
      my vocation and conscience crave plainness of me. Therefore, Madam, to yourself I say that which I speak in public
      place. Whensoever the Nobility of this realm shall<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_283">283</span> consent that ye
      be subject to an unfaithful husband, they do as much as in them lieth to renounce Christ, to banish His truth from
      them, to betray the freedom of this realm, and perchance they shall in the end do small comfort to yourself.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p186" shownumber="no">At these words, howling was heard, and tears might have been seen in greater abundance than the matter required. John Erskine
      of Dun, a man of meek and gentle spirit, stood beside, and entreated what he could do to mitigate her anger, giving
      her many pleasing words of her beauty, of her excellence, and saying that all the princes of Europe would be glad to
      seek her favours. But all this was to cast oil in the flaming fire. The said John stood still, without any alteration
      of countenance for a long season, while the Queen gave place to her inordinate passion.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p187" shownumber="no">In the end he said, "Madam, I speak in God's presence. I never delighted in the weeping of any of God's creatures; yea, I
      can scarcely well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty's
      weeping. Seeing, however, that I have offered you no just occasion to be offended, but have spoken the truth as my
      vocation craves of me, I must sustain your Majesty's tears, albeit unwillingly, rather than dare hurt my conscience,
      or betray my commonwealth through my silence."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p188" shownumber="no">Herewith was the Queen more offended, and commanded the said John to leave the cabinet, and to abide her pleasure in the
      chamber. The Laird of Dun tarried, and Lord John of Coldingham came into the cabinet, and there they both remained
      with her for nearly an hour. The said John stood in the chamber, as one whom men had never seen, so afraid were all,
      except that the Lord Ochiltree bare him company. Therefore began he to forge talk with the ladies who were sitting
      there in all their gorgeous apparel. This espied, he merrily said, "O fair Ladies, how pleasing were this life of yours
      if it should ever abide, and in the end we might pass to heaven with all this gay gear. Fie upon that knave Death,
      who will come whether we will or not! When he has laid on his arrest, the foul worms will be busy with this flesh,
      be it never<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_284">284</span> so fair and so tender; and the silly soul shall, I fear,
      be so feeble that it can neither carry with it gold, garnishing, targetting, pearl, nor precious stones." By such means
      procured he the company of women; and so passed the time until the Laird of Dun desired him to depart to his house.
      The Queen would have sought the censement of the Lords of Articles as to whether such manner of speaking as that of
      the said John deserved not punishment; but she was counselled to desist: and so that storm quieted in appearance, but
      never in the heart.

      She set at liberty the Archbishop of St. Andrews, and the rest of the Papists, formerly put in prison for violating
      the laws. Lethington showed himself not a little offended that any bruit of the Queen's marriage with the son of the
      King of Spain should have risen; for he took upon him that such a thing never entered into her heart. How true that
      was, we shall afterwards hear. The object of all his acquaintance and complaint was to discredit John Knox, who had
      affirmed that such a marriage was both proponed and accepted by the Cardinal upon the part of our Queen. In his absence,
      Lethington had run into a very evil bruit among the Nobility for too much serving the Queen's affections against the
      commonwealth; and therefore, as one that lacketh no worldly wisdom, he had made provision both in England and in Scotland.
      In England he had travailed for the freedom of the Earl Bothwell, and by that means obtained promise of his favour.
      He had there also made arrangements for the home-coming of the Earl of Lennox. In Scotland, he joined with the Earl
      of Atholl: him he promoted and set forward in Court, and so the Earl of Moray began to be defaced. And yet Lethington
      at all times showed a fair countenance to the said Earl.

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p191" shownumber="no">The Queen spent the rest of that summer in her progress throughout the West country, where in all towns and gentlemen's places
      she had her Mass. This coming to the ears of John Knox, he began that form of prayer which ordinarily he sayeth after
      thanksgiving at his table: "1. Deliver us, O Lord, from the bondage of idolatry. 2. Preserve and keep us from the tyranny
      of strangers. 3. Continue us in quietness and concord amongst ourselves, if Thy good pleasure be, O Lord, for a season,"
      etc. Divers of the familiars of the said John asked him why he prayed for quietness to continue for a season, and not
      rather absolutely that we should continue in quietness. His answer was that he durst not pray but in faith; and faith
      in God's Word assured him that constant quietness could not continue in that realm where idolatry had been suppressed,
      and then been permitted to be erected again.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p192" shownumber="no">From the West country, the Queen passed to Argyll to the hunting, and afterwards returned to Stirling. The Earl of Moray,
      the Lord Robert of Holyroodhouse, and Lord John of Coldingham, passed to the Northland. Justice Courts were holden;
      thieves and murderers were punished; two witches were burned, the elder so blinded with the Devil that she affirmed
      that no judge had power over her.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p192.1">The Death of Lord John of Coldingham.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p193" shownumber="no">At that same time, Lord John of Coldingham departed this life in Inverness. It was affirmed that he commanded such as were
      beside him to say to the Queen that, unless she left off her idolatry, God would not fail to plague her. He asked God's
      mercy that he had so far borne with her in her impiety, and had maintained her in the same. No one thing did he more
      regret than that he had flattered, fostered, and maintained her in her wickedness against God and His servants. And
      in very deed he had great cause to lament his wickedness; for, besides all his other infirmities, he, in the end, for
      the Queen's pleasure, became enemy to virtue and virtuous men, and a patron to impiety to the uttermost of his power.
      Yea, his venom was so kindled against God and his Word, that in his rage he burst forth with these words: "Before I
      see the Queen's Majesty so troubled<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_286">286</span> with the railing of these knaves,
      I shall have the best of them sticked in the pulpit."

<p id="iii.iv-p194" shownumber="no">What further villainy came forth from the stinking throats and mouths of both, modesty will not suffer us to write. If Lord
      John had grace to repent unfeignedly thereof, it is no small document to God's mercies. Howsoever God wrought with
      him, the Queen regarded his words as wind, or else thought them to have been forged by others, and not to have proceeded
      from himself. She affirmed plainly that they were devised by the Laird of Pittarrow and Mr. John Wood, both of whom
      she hated, because they did not flatter her in her dancing and other doings. One thing in plain words she spake, "God
      always took from her those persons in whom she had greatest pleasure:" that she repented; but of further wickedness
      there was no mention.

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p195" shownumber="no">While the Queen lay at Stirling, with her idolatry in her chapel, certain dontibours and others of the French menyie were
      left in the Palace of Holyroodhouse. These raised up their Mass more publicly than they had done at any time before.
      Upon those same Sundays that the Church of Edinburgh had the ministration of the Lord's Table, the Papists, in great
      numbers, resorted to the Abbey, to their abomination. This understood, divers of the brethren, being sorely offended,
      consulted as to redress of that enormity. Certain of the most zealous and most upright in the religion, were appointed
      to watch the Abbey, and note the persons who resorted to the Mass. Perceiving a great number to enter the chapel, some
      of the brethren did also burst in. Thereat the priest and the French dames, being afraid, made the shout to be sent
      to the town; while Madame Raulet, mistress of the Queen's dontibours (for maids that court could not then bear) posted
      on with all diligence to the Comptroller, the Laird of Pittarrow, who was then in St. Giles's Kirk at the sermon, and
      cried for his assistance, to save her life and to save the Queen's Palace. He, with greater haste than need required,
      obeyed her desire, and took with him the Provost, the Bailies, and a great part of the faithful. But when they came
      to the place where the fear was bruited<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_287">287</span> to have been, they found all
      things quiet, except the tumult they brought with themselves, and peaceable men looking to the Papists, and forbidding
      them to transgress the laws.

<p id="iii.iv-p196" shownumber="no">True it is that a zealous brother, named Patrick Cranston, passed into the chapel, and finding the altar covered, and the
      priest ready to go to that abomination, the Mass, said, "The Queen's Majesty is not here; how darest thou then be so
      malapert, as openly to do against the law?" No further was done or said, and yet the bruit was posted to the Queen,
      with such information as the Papists could give; and this found as much credit as their hearts could have wished for.
      Here was so heinous a crime in her eyes, that there was no satisfaction for that sin, without blood. Without delay,
      Andrew Armstrong and Patrick Cranston were summoned to find surety to underlie the law, for "forethought, felony, hamesucken,

      stood, and requiring their assistance. This he did in tenor as here follows—

      because they, with two or three more, passed to the Abbey upon Sunday, the 15th of August, to behold and note what
      persons repaired to the Mass. They did so, because on the Sunday before (the Queen's Grace being absent) there resorted
      to that idol a rascal multitude, the Papists having openly the least devilish ceremony,<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p200.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p200.1">216</a></sup>

      are directed against them; no doubt, to make preparation upon a few, that a door may be opened to execute cruelty upon
      a greater multitude. If it so come to pass, God, no doubt, has justly recompensed our former negligence and ingratitude

      we, alas! preferring the pleasure of flesh and blood to the pleasure and commandment of our God, have suffered that

<p id="iii.iv-p205" shownumber="no">The brethren, advertised by this bill, prepared themselves (as many as were thought expedient for every town and province)
      to keep the day appointed. But by the means of false brethren, the letter came to the hands of the Queen, in this manner.
      It was read in the town of Ayr, where was present Robert Cunningham, minister of Failford, who then was reputed an
      earnest professor of the Evangel. He, by means we know not, got the said letter, and sent it with his token to Master
      Henry Sinclair, then President of the Seat and College of Justice, and styled Bishop of Ross, a perfect hypocrite,
      and a conjured enemy of Christ Jesus, whom God afterwards struck according to his deservings. The said Mr. Henry was
      enemy to all that unfeignedly professed the Lord Jesus, but chiefly to John Knox, for the liberty of his tongue; for
      he had affirmed, as ever still he doth affirm, that a bishop that receives profit, and feeds not the flock by his own
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_290">290</span> labours, is both a thief and a murderer. The said Mr. Henry, thinking
      himself happy to have found so good occasion to trouble John Knox, whose life he hated, posted the said letter, with
      his counsel, to the Queen, who then lay in Stirling.

<p id="iii.iv-p206" shownumber="no">The letter being read, it was concluded by the Council of the Cabinet, that is, by the most secret Council, that it imported
      treason; and the Queen was not a little rejoiced, for she thought to be revenged for once on her great enemy. It was
      also concluded that the Nobility should be written for, that the condemnation should have the greater authority. The
      day appointed was about the midst of December; and this was kept by the whole Council, and by divers others, such as
      the Master of Maxwell, the old Laird of Lethington, and the said President. In the meantime, the Earl of Moray returned
      from the north, and to him the Secretary Lethington opened the matter as best pleased him.

      he had so highly offended the Queen's Majesty. That, they feared, would come to a great inconvenience to himself, if

      the Queen and Council sat. These had been reasoning amongst themselves before, but had not fully satisfied the Secretary's
      mind. And so the Queen had retired to her cabinet, and the Lords were talking each one with other, as occasion served.

      sometimes the one occupying her ear, sometimes the other. Her pomp lacked one principal point, to wit, womanly gravity;
      for when she saw John Knox standing at the other end of the table bare-headed, she first smiled, and after gave a gawf
      of laughter. When her placeboes gave their plaudits, affirming, with like countenance, "This is a good beginning,"

<p id="iii.iv-p247" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Remember yourself, my Lord. There is a difference betwixt a lawful convocation, and an unlawful. If I have been
      guilty in this, I have often offended since I came last to Scotland: for what convocation of the brethren has ever
      been to this day in which my pen served not? Before this, no man laid it to my charge as a crime.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p248" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Then was then, and now is now. We have no need of such convocations as sometimes we have had.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p249" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> The time that has been is even now before my eyes; for I see the poor flock in no less danger than it has been
      at any time before, except that the Devil has gotten a visor upon his face. Before, he came in with his own face, discovered
      by open tyranny, seeking the destruction of all that refused idolatry: and then, I think ye will confess, the brethren
      lawfully assembled themselves for defence of their lives. Now the Devil comes under the cloak of justice, to do that
      which God would not suffer him to do by strength.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p250" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> What is this? Methinks ye trifle with him. Who gave him authority to make convocation of my lieges? Is not

</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p253" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Madam, I began to reason with the Secretary, whom I take to be a far better dialectician than your Grace is,
      that all convocations are not unlawful. And now my Lord Ruthven has given the instance. If your Grace will deny this,
      I shall address myself to the proof.

<p id="iii.iv-p255" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> I will say nothing against your religion, nor against your convening to your sermons. But what authority have
      ye to convocate my subjects when ye will, without my commandment?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p256" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I have no pleasure to decline from the former purpose. And yet, Madam, to satisfy your Grace's two questions,
      I answer that at my will I never convened four persons in Scotland; but, upon the instructions of the brethren, I have
      given divers notifications, and great multitudes have assembled. If your Grace complain that this was done without
      your Grace's commandment, I answer—So has all that God has blessed within this realm from the beginning of this action.
      Therefore, Madam, I must be convicted by a just law that I have done against the duty of God's messenger in writing
      this letter, before either I be sorry, or yet repent for the doing of it, as my Lord Secretary would persuade me. What
      I have done, I have done at the commandment of the general Kirk of this realm; and, therefore, I think I have done
      no wrong.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p257" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> Ye shall not escape so. Is it not treason, my Lords, to accuse a prince of cruelty? I think there be Acts of

<p id="iii.iv-p258" shownumber="no">That was granted by many.</p>

<p id="iii.iv-p260" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> Read this part of your own bill, which began, "These fearful summonses are directed against them, to wit the
      brethren foresaid, to make, no doubt, preparation upon a few, that a door may be opened to execute cruelty upon a greater
      multitude." Lo, what say ye to that?

<p id="iii.iv-p261" shownumber="no">Many doubted what the said John should answer.</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p262" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Is it lawful for me, Madam, to answer for myself? Or shall I be condemned before I be heard?

<p id="iii.iv-p263" shownumber="no"><i>Queen.</i> Say what ye can, for I think ye have enough ado.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p264" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I will first, then, desire this of your Grace, Madam, and of this most honourable audience, whether your Grace
      knows not that the obstinate Papists are deadly enemies to all such as profess the Evangel of Jesus Christ, and that
      they
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_297">297</span> most earnestly desire the extermination of them, and of the true doctrine
      that is taught within this realm?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p265" shownumber="no">The Queen held her peace; but all the Lords, with common voice, said, "God forbid that either the lives of the faithful,
      or yet the staying of teaching and preaching, stood in the power of the Papists: just experience has told us what cruelty
      lies in their hearts."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p266" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I must proceed, then, seeing that I perceive that all will grant that it was a barbarous cruelty to destroy
      such a multitude as profess the Evangel of Jesus Christ within this realm. This, oftener than once or twice, has been
      attempted by force, as things done of late days do testify. Disappointed by God and His providence, the Papists have
      invented more crafty and dangerous practices, to wit, to make the prince party, under colour of law: what they could
      not do by open force, they hope to perform by crafty deceit. For who thinks, my Lords, that the insatiable cruelty
      of the Papists within this realm shall end in the murdering of these two brethren now unjustly summoned, and more unjustly
      to be accused? I think no man of judgment can so esteem, but rather the direct contrary; that is, by this few number
      they intend to prepare a way to bloody enterprises against the whole. Therefore, Madam, cast up when ye list the Acts
      of your Parliament. I have offended nothing against them. In my letter, I accuse neither your Grace nor your nature
      of cruelty. But I affirm yet again that the pestilent Papists, who have inflamed your Grace without cause against those
      poor men at this present, are the sons of the Devil; and therefore must obey the desires of their father, who has been
      a liar and a murderer from the beginning.

</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p268" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I am in the place where I am demanded of conscience to speak the truth; and therefore I speak. The truth I speak,
      impugn it whoso list. And hereunto I add, Madam, that honest, gentle, and meek natures by appearance, may, by wicked
      and corrupt counsellors, be converted and altered to the direct contrary. We have example in Nero, who, in the
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_298">298</span> beginning of his empire, had some natural shame; but, after his flatterers
      had encouraged him in all impiety, alleging that nothing was either unhonest nor yet unlawful for the personage of
      him who was emperor above others—when he had drunken of this cup, I say, to what enormities he fell: the histories
      bear witness. And now, Madam, to speak plainly, Papists and conjured enemies to Jesus Christ have your Grace's ear
      patent at all times. I assure your Grace they are dangerous counsellors, and that your mother found.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p269" shownumber="no">As this was said, Lethington smiled, and spake secretly to the Queen in her ear; what it was, the table heard not. But immediately
      she addressed her visage, and spake to John Knox.

      was present at the time whereof your Grace complains. Your Grace accused me of having irreverently handled you in the
      pulpit; that I denied. Ye said, What ado had I to speak of your marriage? What was I, that I should mell with such
      matters? I answered that, as touching nature, I was a worm of this earth, and yet a subject of this commonwealth; but
      as touching the office wherein it had pleased God to place me, I was a watchman, both over the realm and over the Kirk
      of God gathered within the same. For that reason, I was bound in conscience to blow the trumpet publicly, oft as ever

      seeing that I have offered your Grace no such occasion, I must rather suffer your Grace to take your own pleasure,

<p id="iii.iv-p275" shownumber="no">John Knox being departed, it was demanded of the Lords and others that were present, every man by his vote, whether John
      Knox had not offended the Queen's Majesty. The Lords voted uniformly that they could find no offence. The Queen had
      retired to her cabinet. The flatterers of the Court, and Lethington principally, raged. The Queen was brought again,
      and placed in her chair, and they were commanded to vote over again. This highly offended the whole Nobility, who began
      to speak in open audience. "What! shall the Laird of Lethington have power to control us: or shall the presence of
      a woman cause us to offend God, and to condemn an innocent against our conscience, for pleasure of<span class="pb"
            id="iii.iv-Page_300">300</span> any creature?" And so the whole Nobility absolved John Knox again, and praised God
      for his modesty, and for his plain and sensible answers. Yea, before the end, it is to be noted that, among so many
      placeboes, we mean the flatterers of the Court, there was not one that plainly durst condemn the poor man that was
      accused, this same God ruling their tongue, as once He ruled the tongue of Balaam, when he would gladly have cursed

      agree with the rest, "Trouble not the bairn: I pray you trouble him not; for he is newly wakened out of his sleep.
      Why should not the old fool follow the footsteps of them that have passed before him." The bishop answered coldly,
      "Your Grace may consider that it is neither affection to the man, nor yet love to his profession, that moves me to
      absolve him; but the simple truth, which plainly appears in his defence, draws me after it, albeit others would have
      condemned him." This said, the Lords and whole assisters arose and departed. That night was neither dancing nor fiddling
      in the Court; for Madam was disappointed of her purpose, which was to have had John Knox at her disposal by vote of

      John, to confess an offence, and to put himself in the Queen's will, they promising that his greatest punishment should
      be to go within the Castle of Edinburgh, and immediately return to his own home. He answered, "God forbid that my confession
      should condemn those noble men who for their conscience' sake, and with the displeasure of the Queen, have absolved
      me. And, further, I am assured that ye will not in earnest desire me to confess an offence, unless ye would desire
      me to cease from preaching: for how can I exhort others to peace and Christian quietness, if I confess myself an author

      of His glory, and the stability of His Kirk within this realm; and yet of late days I have been accused as a seditious
      man, and as one that usurps to myself power that becomes me not. True it is that I have given notification to the Brethren
      in divers quarters concerning the extremity intended against certain faithful men for looking at a priest going to
      Mass,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_302">302</span> and for observing those that transgressed just laws; but that therein

      I was appointed to the one and to the other; and, therefore, in the name of God, I crave your judgments. The danger
      that appeared to me in my accusation was not so fearful as were the words that came to my ears dolorous to my heart;
      for these words were plainly spoken, and that by some Protestants, 'What can the Pope do more than send forth his letters,
      and require them to be obeyed.' Let me have your judgments whether I have usurped any power to myself, or if I have
      but obeyed your commandment."

      the manifest corruption that then declared itself without shame or fear, said, "At one time, hypocrites were known
      by their disguised habits, and we had men as monks, and women as nuns; but now, all things are so changed that we cannot

      of monks and nuns. But, seeing that ye are not ashamed of that unjust profit, would God that therewith ye had the cowl
      of the nun, the veil, yea, and the tail joined with all, that so ye might appear in your own colours." Their liberty
      did so provoke the choler of Lethington, that, in open audience, he gave himself to the Devil, if ever after that day
      he should regard what became of ministers. He should do what he could that his companions should have a skair<sup class="Note"

      from specialities; but so long as Protestants are not ashamed manifestly to act against the Evangel of Jesus Christ,
      so long cannot the ministers of God cease to cry that God will be revenged upon such abusers of His holy Word." Thus
      had the servants of God a double battle; fighting upon the one side against the idolatry and the rest of the abominations
      maintained by the<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_305">305</span> Queen; and upon the other part, against the unthankfulness
      of such as sometime would have been esteemed the chief pillars of the Kirk within the realm. The threatenings of the

      the Earl Marischall's men. He obeyed, but he was speedily relieved; for bloodthirsty men and Papists, such as he is,

      of the preachers, were proclaimed in the public pulpit of Edinburgh, with this complaint directed by the speaker to
      his God. "O Lord, how long shall the wicked prevail against the just! How long shalt Thou suffer Thyself and Thy blessed
      Evangel to be despised of men; of men, we say, that make themselves defenders of the truth. Of Thy manifest and known
      enemies we complain not, but of such as unto whom Thou hast revealed Thy light: for now it comes to our ears that men,

<p id="iii.iv-p293" shownumber="no">The General Assembly, held in June 1564, approaching, to this the great part of those of the Nobility that are called Protestants,
      convened; some for assistance of the ministers, and some to accuse them.... On the first day of the General Assembly,
      the Courtiers and the Lords that depended upon the Court, did not present themselves in session with their brethren.
      Many wondering thereat, an ancient and honourable man, the Laird of Lundie, said, "Nay, I wonder not of their present
      absence; but I wonder that, at our last Assembly, they drew themselves apart, and joined not with us, but drew from
      us some of our ministers, and willed them to conclude such things as were never proponed in the public Assembly. That
      appears to me to be very prejudicial to the liberty of the Kirk. My judgment is, therefore, that they be informed of
      this offence, which the whole brethren have conceived of their former fault; with humble request that, if they be brethren,
      they will assist their brethren with their presence and counsel, for we never had greater<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_307">307</span>      need. If they be minded to fall back from us, it were better we knew it now than afterwards." The whole Assembly agreed
      to this, and gave commission to certain brethren to signify the minds of the Assembly to the Lords: that was done on
      the same afternoon.

<p id="iii.iv-p294" shownumber="no">At first, the Courtiers seemed not a little offended that they should be suspected of defection: yet, upon the morrow, they

      Inner Council House. There were the Duke's Grace, the Earls Argyll, Moray, Morton, Glencairn, Marischall, and Rothes;
      the Master of Maxwell, Secretary Lethington, the Justice Clerk, the Clerk Register, and the Comptroller, the Laird
      of Pittarrow.

<p id="iii.iv-p295" shownumber="no">After a little consultation, they directed a messenger, Mr. George Hay, then called the Minister of the Court, requiring

</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p296" shownumber="no">The Assembly answered that they had convened to deliberate upon the common affairs of the Kirk; and therefore, that they
      could not lack their superintendents and chief ministers, whose judgments were so necessary that, without them, the
      rest should sit as it were idle. They therefore, as before, willed them that, if they acknowledged themselves members
      of the Kirk, they would join with the brethren, and propone in public such things as they pleased; and so they should
      have the assistance of the whole in all things that might conform to God's commandment. Hurt and slander might arise,
      rather than any profit or comfort to the Kirk, were they to send from themselves a portion of their company. For they
      feared that all men should not stand content with the conclusion, where the conference and reasons were only heard
      by a few.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p297" shownumber="no">This answer was not given without cause; for no small travail was made to have drawn some ministers to the faction of the
      courtiers, and to have sustained their arguments and opinions. But when it was perceived by the most politic amongst
      them that they could not prevail by that means, they<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_308">308</span> proponed the matter
      in other terms. Purging themselves first that they never meant to divide themselves from the society of their brethren,
      they said that they had certain heads to confer with certain ministers; and that, to prevent confusion, they thought
      it more expedient to have the conference before a few, rather than in the public audience. The Assembly did still reply,
      that they would not admit secret conference upon those heads that must be concluded by a general vote.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p298" shownumber="no">The Lords promised that no conclusion should be taken, or yet vote required, until their propositions and the reasons should

      the Superintendents of Lothian and Fife, Mr. John Row, Mr. John Craig, William Christison, and Mr. David Lindsay, ministers,

      and John Knox waited upon the scribe. And so they were appointed to sit with the brethren. Because the principal complaint
      touched John Knox, he was also called for.

</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p299" shownumber="no">Secretary Lethington began the harangue, which contained these heads: First, how much we were indebted unto God, by whose
      providence we had liberty of religion under the Queen's Majesty, albeit she was not persuaded in it herself: Secondly,
      how necessary a thing it was that the Queen's Majesty, by all good offices, so spake he, of the Kirk, and of the ministers
      principally, should be retained in the constant opinion that they unfeignedly favoured her advancement, and procured
      her subjects to have a good opinion of her: And, lastly, how dangerous a thing it was that ministers should be noted
      to disagree one from another, in form of prayer for Her Majesty, or in doctrine concerning obedience to Her Majesty's
      authority. "And in these two last heads," said he, "we desire you all to be circumspect; but especially we must crave
      of you, our brother, John Knox, to moderate yourself, as<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_309">309</span> well in form
      of praying for the Queens Majesty, as in doctrine that ye propone touching her estate and obedience. Neither shall
      ye take this," said he, "as spoken to your reproach,
      <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia nevus interdum in corpore pulchro</i>, but because others by your example may imitate
      the like liberty, albeit not with the same modesty and foresight; and wise men do foresee the opinion that may engender
      in the people's heads."

<p id="iii.iv-p300" shownumber="no"><i>John Knox.</i> If such as fear God have occasion to praise Him because idolatry is maintained, the servants of God are
      despised, wicked men are placed again in honour and authority, and, finally, because vice and impiety overflow this
      whole realm without punishment, then have we occasion to rejoice and to praise God. But if those and the like actions
      are wont to provoke God's vengeance against realms and nations, then, in my judgment, the godly within Scotland ought
      to lament and mourn; and so to prevent<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p300.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p300.1">234</a></sup>
      <span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.iv-p300.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.iv-p300.1">234</a></sup>Anticipate.</span>      God's judgments, lest He, finding all in a like security, strike in His hot indignation, perchance beginning at such
      as think they offend not.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p301" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> That is a head wherein ye and I never agreed; for how are ye able to prove that ever God struck or plagued
      a nation or people for the iniquity of their prince, if they themselves lived godly?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p302" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I looked, my Lord, to have audience, until I had absolved the other two parts; but seeing that it pleases your
      Lordship to cut me off before the midst, I will answer your question. The Scripture of God teaches me that Jerusalem
      and Judah were punished for the sin of Manasseh; and if ye will allege that they were punished because they were wicked,
      and offended with their king, and not because their king was wicked, I answer that, albeit the Spirit of God makes
      for me, saying in express words, "For the sin of Manasseh," yet will I not be so obstinate as to lay the whole sin,
      and the plagues that followed, upon the king, and utterly absolve the people. I will grant you that the whole people
      offended with the king: but how, and in what fashion, I fear that ye and I shall not agree. I doubt not but that the
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_310">310</span> great multitude accompanied him in all the abominations which he did;
      for idolatry and a false religion have ever been, are, and will be pleasing to the most part of men. To affirm that
      all Judah committed really the acts of his impiety, is but to affirm that which neither has certainty, nor yet appearance
      of truth. Who can think it possible that all those of Jerusalem should so shortly turn to external idolatry, considering
      the notable reformation in the days of Hezekiah, a short time before? But yet, the text says, "Manasseh made Judah
      and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err." True it is; for the one part willingly followed him in his idolatry, and
      the other, by reason of his authority, suffered him to defile Jerusalem, and the temple of God, with all abominations.
      So were they all criminal for his sin; the one by act and deed, the other by suffering and permission. Even so, all
      Scotland is guilty this day of the Queen's idolatry, and ye, my Lords, especially, above all others.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p303" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Well, that is the chief head wherein we never agreed; but of that we shall speak hereafter. What will
      ye say as touching the moving of the people to have a good opinion of the Queen's Majesty, and as concerning obedience
      to be given to her authority, as also of the form of the prayer which commonly ye use, and so on?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p304" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> My Lord, a good conscience will not suffer me to move the people more earnestly, or to pray otherwise than heretofore
      I have done. He who knows the secrets of hearts knows that, privately and publicly, I have called to God for the Queen's
      conversion, and have willed the people to do the same, showing them the dangerous estate wherein not only she herself
      stands, but also the whole realm, by the reason of her indurate blindness.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p305" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> That is exactly wherein we find greatest fault. Your extremity against the Queen's Mass, in particular,
      passes measure. Ye call her a slave to Satan; ye affirm that God's vengeance hangs over the realm by reason of her
      impiety; and what is this else but to rouse up the heart of the people against Her Majesty, and against them that serve
      her?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p306" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_311">311</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p307" shownumber="no">There was heard an exclamation from the rest of the flatterers that such extremity could not profit. The Master of Maxwell
      said in plain words, "If I were in the Queen's Majesty's place, I would not suffer such things as I hear."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p308" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> If the words of preachers shall always be wrested to the worst construction, then will it be hard to speak of
      anything so circumspectly (provided that the truth be spoken) that it shall not escape the censure of the calumniator.
      The most vehement, and, as ye put it, excessive manner of prayer that I use in public is this, "O Lord, if it be Thy
      pleasure, purge the heart of the Queen's Majesty from the venom of idolatry, and deliver her from the bondage and thraldom
      of Satan in which she has been brought up, and yet remains, for the lack of true doctrine; and let her see, by the
      illumination of Thy Holy Spirit, that there is no means to please Thee but by Jesus Christ, Thy only Son, and that
      Jesus Christ cannot be found but in Thy holy Word, nor yet received but as it prescribes; which is, to renounce our
      own wisdom and preconceived opinion, and worship Thee as Thou commandest; that in so doing she may avoid that eternal
      damnation which abides all who are obstinate and impenitent unto the end; and that this poor realm may also escape
      that plague and vengeance which inevitably follow idolatry, maintained against Thy manifest Word and the open light
      thereof." This, said he, is the form of my common prayer, as yourselves can witness. Now, I would hear what is worthy
      of reprehension in it.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p309" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> There are three things that I never liked. The first is that ye pray for the Queen's Majesty with a condition,
      saying, "Illuminate her heart, if it be Thy good pleasure." It may appear from these words that ye doubt of her conversion.
      Where have ye the example of such prayer?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p310" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Wheresoever the examples are, I am assured of the rule, which is this, If we shall ask anything according to
      His will, He shall hear us; and our Master, Christ Jesus, commanded us to pray unto our Father, "Thy will be done."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p311" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_312">312</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p312" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> But where do ye ever find one of the Prophets so to have prayed?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p313" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> It sufficeth me, my Lord, that the Master and Teacher of both Prophets and Apostles has taught me so to pray.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p314" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> But, in so doing, ye put a doubt in the people's head concerning her conversion.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p315" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Not I, my Lord. Her own obstinate rebellion causes more than me to doubt of her conversion.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p316" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Wherein rebels she against God?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p317" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> In all the actions of her life, but in these two heads especially; firstly, she will not hear the preaching
      of the blessed Evangel of Jesus Christ; and, secondly, she maintains that idol, the Mass.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p318" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> She does not think that rebellion, but good religion.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p319" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> So thought they that at one time offered their children to Moloch; and yet the Spirit of God affirms that they
      offered them unto devils, and not unto God. This day the Turks think they have a better religion than that of the Papists.
      I think ye will excuse neither of them from committing rebellion against God: nor can ye justly excuse the Queen, unless
      ye make God to be partial.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p320" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> But yet, why pray ye not for her, without moving any doubt?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p321" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Because I have learned to pray in faith. Now faith, ye know, depends upon the words of God, and the Word teaches
      me that prayers profit the sons and daughters of God's election. Whether she be one of these or not, I have just cause
      to doubt; and, therefore, I pray God "illuminate her heart," if it be His good pleasure.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p322" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> But yet ye can produce the example of none that so has prayed before you.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p323" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I have already answered that; but yet, for further declaration, I will demand a question. Do ye think that the
      Apostles prayed themselves as they commanded others to pray?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p324" shownumber="no">"Who doubts of that?" said the whole company that were present.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p325" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_313">313</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p326" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Well then, I am assured that Peter said these words to Simon Magus, "Repent therefore of this thy wickedness,
      and pray to God, that, if it be possible, the thought of your heart may be forgiven thee." Here we may plainly see
      that Peter joins a condition with his commandment that Simon should repent and pray, to wit, if it were possible that
      his sin might be forgiven; for he was not ignorant that some sins were unto the death, and so without all hope of repentance
      or remission. Think ye not, my Lord Secretary, there may touch my heart, concerning the Queen's conversion, the same
      doubt that then touched the heart of the Apostle?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p327" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> I would never hear you or any other call that in doubt.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p328" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> But your will is no assurance to my conscience. And, to speak freely, my Lord, I wonder if ye yourself doubt
      not of the Queen's conversion; for more evident signs of induration

      and still do appear in her, than outwardly Peter could have espied in Simon Magus. Albeit at one time he had been a
      sorcerer, he joined with the Apostles, believed, and was baptized; and albeit the venom of avarice remained in his
      heart, and he would have bought the Holy Ghost, yet, when he heard the fearful threatenings of God pronounced against
      him, he trembled, desired the assistance of the prayers of the Apostles, and humbled himself like a true penitent,
      so far as the judgment of man could pierce, and yet we see that Peter doubted of his conversion. Why then may not all
      the godly justly doubt of the conversion of the Queen, who has practised idolatry (which is no less odious in the sight
      of God than is the other) and still continues in the same, yea, who despises all threatenings, and refuses all godly
      admonitions?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p329" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Why say ye that she refuses admonition? She will gladly hear any man.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p330" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> But what obedience, to God or to His Word, ensues of all that is spoken to her? Or when shall she be seen to
      give her presence to the public preaching?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p331" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> I think never, so long as she is thus treated.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p332" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_314">314</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p333" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> And so long ye and all others must be content that I pray, so that I may be assured of being heard by my God,
      that His good will may be done, either in making her comfortable to His Kirk, or, if He has appointed her to be a scourge
      to it, that we may have patience, and she may be bridled.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p334" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Well let us come to the second head. Where find ye that the Scripture calls any the bond slaves to Satan?
      or that the Prophets of God speak so irreverently of kings and princes?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p335" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> The Scripture says, that "by nature we are all the sons of wrath." Our Master, Christ Jesus, affirms, that "such
      as do sin are servants to sin," and that it is the only Son of God that sets men at freedom. Now, what difference there
      is betwixt the sons of wrath, and the servants of sin, and the slaves to the Devil, I understand not, except I be taught.
      If the sharpness of the term offend you, I have not invented that phrase of speech, but have learned it out of God's
      Scripture; for those words I find spoken unto Paul, "Behold, I send thee to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, that
      they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God." Mark these words, my Lord, and sturr not
      at the speaking of the Holy Ghost. The same Apostle, writing to his scholar Timothy, says, "Instruct with meekness
      those that are contrary minded, if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may know the truth, and that
      they may come to amendment, out of the snare of the Devil, which are taken of him at his will." If your Lordship rightly
      considers these sentences, ye shall not only find my words to be the words of the Holy Ghost, but also that the condition
      which I use to add, has the assurance of God's Scriptures.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p336" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> But they spake nothing against kings in especial, and yet your continual crying is, "The Queen's idolatry,
      the Queen's Mass, will provoke God's vengeance!"
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p337" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> In the former sentences I hear not kings and queens excepted, but all unfaithful are pronounced to stand in
      one rank, and to be in bondage to one tyrant, the Devil. But belike, my Lord, ye little regard the estate wherein they
      stand, when ye would have them so flattered, that the danger<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_315">315</span> thereof
      should neither be known nor declared to the poor people.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p338" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Where will ye find that any of the Prophets did so entreat kings and queens, rulers or magistrates?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p339" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> In more places than one. Ahab was a king, and Jezebel was a queen, and yet of what the Prophet Elijah said to
      the one and to the other, I suppose ye are not ignorant?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p340" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> That was not cried out before the people to make them odious to their subjects.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p341" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> That Elijah said, "Dogs shall lick the blood of Ahab, and eat the flesh of Jezebel," the Scriptures assure me;
      but I read not that it was whispered in their own ear, or in a corner. The plain contrary appears to me. That is, both
      the people and the Court understood well enough what the Prophet had promised; for so witnessed Jehu, after God's vengeance
      had stricken Jezebel.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p342" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> They were singular motions of the Spirit of God, and appertain nothing to this our age.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p343" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Then the Scripture has far deceived me, for St. Paul teaches me that, "Whatsoever is written within the Holy
      Scriptures, is written for our instruction." And my Master said that "Every learned and wise scribe brings forth his
      treasure, both things old and things new." And the Prophet Jeremiah affirms that "Every realm and every city that likewise
      offends, as then did Jerusalem, should likewise be punished." Why then, I neither see nor yet can understand that the
      acts of the ancient Prophets, and the fearful judgments of God executed before us upon the disobedient, appertain not
      unto this our age. But now, to put an end to this head, my Lord, the Prophets of God have not spared to rebuke wicked
      kings, as well to their face as before the people and subjects. Elisha feared not to say to King Jehoram, "What have
      I to do with thee? Get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother; for as the Lord of Hosts
      lives, in whose sight I stand, if it were not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah, I would
      not have looked toward thee nor seen thee." It is plain that the Prophet was a subject in the kingdom of Israel,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_316">316</span> and yet how little reverence he gives to the King. Jeremiah the Prophet
      was commanded to cry to the King and to the Queen, and to say, "Behave yourselves lawfully; execute justice and judgment;
      or else your carcases shall be cast to the heat of the day, and unto the frost of the night." Unto Coniah, Shallum,
      and Zedekiah, he speaks in special, and shows to them, in his public sermons, their miserable ends; and therefore ye
      ought not to think it strange, my Lord, that the servants of God mark the vice of kings and queens, as well as of other
      offenders, and that because their sins are more noisome to the commonwealth than are the sins of inferior persons.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p344" shownumber="no">For the most part of this reasoning, Secretary Lethington leaned upon the Master of Maxwell's breast, who said, "I am almost
      weary: I would that some other would reason in the chief head, which is not touched."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p345" shownumber="no">The Earl of Morton, Chancellor, commanded Mr. George Hay to reason against John Knox, in the head of obedience due unto magistrates;
      and he began so to do.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p346" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Brother, I am well content that ye reason with me, because I know you to be both a man of learning and of modesty:
      but that ye shall oppose yourself to a truth of which, I suppose, your own conscience is no less persuaded than is
      mine, I cannot well approve. I would be sorry that you and I should be reputed to reason as two scholars of Pythagoras,
      to show the quickness of our imagination. I protest here, before God, that, whatsoever I sustain, I do the same of
      conscience; yea, I dare no more sustain a proposition known unto myself untrue, than dare I teach false doctrine in
      the public place. Therefore, Brother, if conscience move you to oppose yourself to that doctrine which ye have heard
      from my mouth in that matter, do it boldly: it shall never offend me. But it pleases me not that ye be found to oppose
      yourself to me, if ye are persuaded in the same truth. In that there may be greater inconvenience than either ye or
      I do consider for the present.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p347" shownumber="no"><i>Hay.</i> Far be it from me to prove myself willing to impugn or confute that head of doctrine, which not only ye,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_317">317</span> but many others, yea, and I myself have affirmed; for so should I
      be found contrarious to myself. My Lord Secretary knows my judgment in that head.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p348" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Marry; ye are well the worse of the two. I remember well your reasoning when the Queen was in Carrick.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p349" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Well, seeing, Brother, that God has made you occupy the chair of truth, in which, I am sure, we will agree in
      all principal heads of doctrine, let it never be said that we disagree in disputation.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p350" shownumber="no">John Knox was moved thus to speak, because he understood more of the craft than the other did.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p351" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Well, I am persuaded in this last head somewhat better than I was in the other two. Mr. Knox, yesterday
      we heard your judgment upon the 13th to the Romans; we heard the mind of the Apostle well opened; we heard the causes
      why God has established powers upon the earth; we heard the necessity that mankind has of the same; and we heard the
      duty of magistrates sufficiently declared; but in two things I was offended, and so I think were some more of my Lords
      that were then present. The one was that ye made difference betwixt the ordinance of God and the persons that were
      placed in authority; and ye affirmed that men might refuse the persons, and yet not offend against God's ordinance.
      This is the one; the other ye had no time to explain; but methought ye meant this,—that subjects were not bound to
      obey their princes if they commanded unlawful things; but that they might resist their princes, and were never bound
      to suffer.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p352" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> In very deed ye have rightly both marked my words, and understood my mind; for I have long been of that same
      judgment, and so I yet remain.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p353" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> How will ye prove your division and difference, and that the person placed in authority may be resisted,
      and God's ordinance not transgressed, seeing that the Apostle says, "He that resists the powers, resisteth the ordinance
      of God."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p354" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> My Lord, the plain words of the Apostle make the difference, and the acts of many approved by God prove my
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_318">318</span> affirmative. First, the Apostle affirms that the powers are ordained
      of God for the preservation of quiet and peaceable men, and for the punishment of malefactors. From this it is plain
      that the ordinance of God and the power given unto men is one thing, and the person clad with the power or with the
      authority is another. God's ordinance is the conservation of mankind, the punishment of vice, and the maintaining of
      virtue, which is in itself holy, just, constant, stable, and perpetual. But men clad with the authority are commonly
      profane and unjust; yea, they are mutable and transitory, and subject to corruption. God threateneth them by His Prophet
      David, saying, "I have said ye are gods, and every one of you the sons of the Most Highest; but ye shall die as men,
      and the princes shall fall like others." Here I am assured that persons, the soul and body of wicked princes, are threatened
      with death: I think that ye will not affirm that so also are the authority, the ordinance and the power, wherewith
      God has endued such persons; for, as I have said, as it is holy, so is it the permanent will of God. Now, my Lord,
      it is evident that the prince may be resisted, and yet the ordinance of God not violated. The people resisted Saul,
      when he had sworn by the living God that Jonathan should die. The people, I say, swore to the contrary, and delivered
      Jonathan, so that not a hair of his head fell. Now, Saul was the anointed king, and they were his subjects, and yet
      they so resisted him that they made him no better than mansworn.<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p354.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p354.1">236</a></sup>

<p id="iii.iv-p355" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> I doubt if in so doing the people did well.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p356" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> The Spirit of God accuses them not of any crime, but rather praises them, and condemns the king, as well for
      his foolish vow and law made without God, as for his cruel mind, that would have punished an innocent man so severely.
      I shall not stand entirely upon this: what follows shall confirm it. This same Saul commanded Abimelech and the priests
      of the Lord to be slain, because they had committed treason, as he alleged, for intercommuning with David. His guard
      and principal servants would not obey his unjust commandment; but Doeg, the flatterer, put the king's cruelty to
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_319">319</span> execution. I will not ask your judgment whether the servants of the
      king, in not obeying his commandment, resisted God or not; or whether Doeg, in murdering the priests, gave obedience
      to a just authority. I have the Spirit of God, speaking by the mouth of David, to assure me of the one as well as of
      the other; for he, in his fifty-second Psalm, condemns that act as a most cruel murder; and affirms that God will punish
      not only the commander but the merciless executor. I conclude that they who gainstood his commandment resisted not
      the ordinance of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p357" shownumber="no">And now, my Lord, to answer to the statement of the Apostle, where he affirms that such as resist the power resist the ordinance
      of God, I say that the power in that place is not to be understood to be the unjust commandment of men, but the just
      power wherewith God has armed His magistrates and lieutenants to punish sin and maintain virtue. If any man enterprise
      to take from the hands of a lawful judge a murderer, an adulterer, or any other malefactor that by God's law deserves
      death, this same man resists God's ordinance, and procures to himself vengeance and condemnation, because he has stayed
      God's sword from striking. But this is not the case if men, in the fear of God, oppose themselves to the fury and blind
      rage of princes; in doing so, they do not resist God, but the Devil, who abuses the sword and authority of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p358" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> I sufficiently understand what ye mean; and to the one part I will not oppose myself. But I doubt of the
      other. If the Queen commanded me to slay John Knox, because she is offended at him, I would not obey her. But, were
      she to command others to do it, or by a colour of justice to take his life from him, I cannot tell if I should be found
      to defend him against the Queen and against her officers.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p359" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Under protestation that the audience think not that I seek favours for myself, my Lord, I say that, if ye be
      persuaded of my innocency, and if God has given you such power and credit as might deliver me, and yet you suffered
      me to perish, in so doing you should be criminal, and guilty of my blood.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p360" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Prove that, and win the play.

<p id="iii.iv-p361" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_320">320</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p362" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Well, my Lord, remember your promise, and I shall be short in my probation. The Prophet Jeremiah was apprehended
      by the priests and prophets, who were a part of the authority within Jerusalem, and by the multitude of the people,
      and this sentence was pronounced against him, "Thou shalt die the death; for thou hast said, this house shall be like
      Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without inhabitant." The princes, hearing the uproar, came from the king's
      house, and sat down in judgment in the entry of the new gate of the Lord's House, and there the priests and the prophets,
      before the princes, and before all the people, stated their accusation in these words, "This man is worthy to die,
      for he has prophesied against this city, as your ears have heard." Jeremiah answered that whatsoever he had spoken
      proceeded from God; and therefore said he, "As for me, I am in your hands: do with me as ye think good and right. But
      know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon your souls, and upon this
      city, and upon the habitations thereof; for of truth the Lord has sent me to you, to speak all these words." Now, my
      Lord, if the prophets and the whole people should have been guilty of the Prophet's blood, how shall ye or others be
      judged innocent before God, if ye suffer the blood of such as have not deserved death to be shed when ye may save it?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p363" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> The cases are nothing like.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p364" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I would like to learn wherein the dissimilitude stands.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p365" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> First, the king had not condemned him to death. And next, the false prophets and the priests and the people
      accused him without a cause, and therefore they could not but be guilty of his blood.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p366" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Neither of these fights against my argument; for, albeit the king was neither present, nor yet had condemned
      him, the princes and chief councillors were there sitting in judgment. They represented the king's person and authority,
      hearing the accusation laid to the charge of the Prophet. Therefore he forewarns them of the danger, as I have already
      said, that, if he should be condemned and put to death, the<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_321">321</span> king, the
      council, and the whole city of Jerusalem should be guilty of his blood, because he had committed no crime worthy of
      death. If ye think that they should all have been criminal, only because they all accused him, the plain text witnesses
      the contrary. The princes defended him, and so no doubt did a great part of the people; and yet he boldly affirms that
      they should be all guilty of his blood if he should be put to death. The Prophet Ezekiel gives the reason why all are
      guilty of a common corruption. He says, "I sought a man amongst them that should make up the hedge, and stand in the
      gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none; therefore have I poured my indignation
      upon them." From this, my Lord, it is plain that God craves not only that a man do no iniquity in his own person, but
      also that he oppose himself to all iniquity, so far as in him lies.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p367" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Then ye will make subjects control their princes and rulers.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p368" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> And what harm should the commonwealth receive, if the corrupt affections of ignorant rulers were moderated,
      and so bridled by the wisdom and discretion of godly subjects that they should do wrong nor violence to no man?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p369" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> All this reasoning is not to the purpose; for we reason as if the Queen should become such an enemy to
      our religion, that she should persecute it, and put innocent men to death. This, I am assured, she never intended,
      and never will do. If I should see her again of that purpose, yea, if I should suspect any such thing in her, I should
      be as far forward in that argument as ye or any other within this realm. But there is not such a thing. Our question
      is, whether we may and ought to suppress the Queen's Mass? Or whether her idolatry shall be laid to our charge?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p370" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> What ye may do by force, I dispute not; but what ye may and ought to do by God's express commandment, that I
      can tell. Idolatry ought not only to be suppressed, but the idolater ought to die the death, unless we will accuse
      God.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p371" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> I know that the idolater is commanded to die the death; but by whom?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p372" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> By the people of God. The commandment was<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_322">322</span> given to Israel, as
      ye may read, "Hear, Israel, says the Lord, the statutes and the ordinances of the Lord thy God," etc. Yea, a commandment
      was given, that, if it be heard that idolatry is committed in any one city, inquisition shall be taken; and, if it
      be found true, the whole body of the people shall then arise and destroy that city, sparing in it neither man, woman,
      nor child.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p373" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> But there is no commandment given to the people to punish their king if he be an idolater.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p374" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I find no privilege to offend God's Majesty granted to kings, by God, more than to the people.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p375" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> I grant that; but yet the people may not be judges to their king to punish him, albeit he be an idolater.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p376" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> God is the Universal Judge, as well of the king as of the people. What His Word commands to be punished in the
      one, is not to be absolved in the other.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p377" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> We agree in that; but the people may not execute God's judgment. They must leave it to Himself. He will
      either punish it by death, by war, by imprisonment, or by some other plagues.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p378" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I know the last part of your reason to be true; but for the first, that the people, yea, or a part of the people,
      may not execute God's judgments against their king, he being an offender, I am assured ye have no other warrant except
      your own imagination, and the opinion of such as have more fear to offend princes than God.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p379" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Why say ye so? I have the judgments of the most famous men within Europe, and of such as ye yourself will
      confess both godly and learned.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p380" shownumber="no">And with that he called for his papers. When these were produced by Mr. Robert Maitland, he began to read with great gravity
      the judgments of Luther, and Melanchthon, and the minds of Bucer, Musculus, and Calvin, as to how Christians should
      behave themselves in time of persecution: yea, the Book of Baruch was not omitted.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p381" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> The gathering of these things has cost more travail than I have taken these seven years in the reading
      of commentaries.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p382" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_323">323</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p383" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> The more pity; and yet, let others judge what ye have profited your own cause. As for my argument, I am assured
      ye have weakened it in nothing; for your first two witnesses speak against the Anabaptists, who deny that Christians
      should be subject to magistrates, or that it is lawful for a Christian to be a magistrate. That opinion I no less abhor
      than ye do, or than does any other that lives. The others speak of Christians subject to tyrants and infidels, so dispersed
      that they have no other force but only to sob to God for deliverance. That such, indeed, should hazard any further
      than these godly men direct them, I cannot hastily counsel. But my argument has another ground; for I speak of the
      people assembled together in one body of one commonwealth, to whom God has given sufficient force, not only to resist,
      but also to suppress all kind of open idolatry. Such a people, I affirm yet again, are bound to keep their land clean
      and unpolluted.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p384" shownumber="no">That this my division shall not appear strange to you, ye should understand that God required one thing of Abraham and of
      his seed, when he and they were strangers and pilgrims in Egypt and Canaan; and another thing when they were delivered
      from the bondage of Egypt, and the possession of the land of Canaan was granted to them. At the first, and during all
      the time of their bondage, God craved no more than that Abraham should not defile himself with idolatry. Neither was
      he nor his posterity commanded to destroy the idols that were in Canaan or in Egypt. But when God gave them the possession
      of the land, He gave them this strait commandment, "Beware lest ye make league or confederacy with the inhabitants
      of this land: give not thy sons unto their daughters, nor yet give thy daughters unto their sons. But this shall ye
      do unto them, cut down their groves, destroy their images, break down their altars, and leave thou no kind of remembrance
      of those abominations, which the inhabitants of the land used before: for thou art a people holy unto the Lord thy
      God. Defile not thyself, therewith, with their gods."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p385" shownumber="no">Ye, my Lords, and all such as have professed the Lord<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_324">324</span> Jesus within this realm,
      are bound to this same commandment. God has wrought no less miracle upon you, both spiritual and corporal, than He
      did upon the carnal seed of Abraham. For you yourselves cannot be ignorant in what estate your bodies and this poor
      realm were, not seven years ago. You and it were both in bondage to a strange nation; and what tyrants reigned over
      your conscience, God perchance may let you feel, because ye do not rightly acknowledge the benefit received. When our
      poor brethren before us gave their bodies to the flames of fire for the testimony of the truth, and when scarcely ten
      that rightly knew God could be found in a country-side, it would have been foolishness to have craved the suppressing
      of idolatry, either by the Nobility, or by the humble subjects. That would have done nothing but expose the simple
      sheep as a prey to the wolves. But since God has multiplied knowledge, and has given the victory to His truth, even
      in the hands of His servants, if ye suffer the land again to be defiled, ye and your Princess shall both drink the
      cup of God's indignation—she for her obstinate abiding in manifest idolatry in the great light of the Evangel of Jesus
      Christ, and ye for your permitting and maintaining her in it.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p386" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> In that point we will never agree; and where find ye, I pray you, that any of the Prophets or of the Apostles
      ever taught such a doctrine as that the people should be plagued for the idolatry of the prince; or that the subjects
      might suppress the idolatry of their rulers, or punish them for the same?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p387" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> My Lord, we know what was the commission given to the Apostles. It was to preach and plant the Evangel of Jesus
      Christ where darkness had dominion before; and therefore it behoved them, first, to let them see the light before they
      should urge them to put to their hands to suppress idolatry. I will not affirm what precepts the Apostles gave to the
      faithful in particular, other than that they commanded all to flee from idolatry. But I find two things which the faithful
      did; the one was, they assisted their preachers, even against the rulers and magistrates; the other was, they suppressed
      idolatry wherever God gave them force, asking no leave of the<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_325">325</span> Emperor,
      or of his deputies. Read the Ecclesiastical History, and ye shall find sufficient example. As to the doctrine of the
      Prophets, we know they were interpreters of the law of God; and we know they spake to the kings as well as to the people.
      I read that neither would hear them; and therefore came the plague of God upon both. But I cannot be persuaded that
      they flattered kings more than the people.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p388" shownumber="no">As I have said, God's laws pronounce sentence of death upon idolatry, without exception of any person. Idolatry is never
      alone; ever does it corrupt religion, and bring with it a filthy and corrupt life. How the Prophets could rightly interpret
      the law, and show the causes of God's judgments, which they ever threatened should follow idolatry, and the rest of
      abominations that accompany it—how they could reprove the vices, and not show the people their duty, I understand not.
      Therefore, I constantly believe that the doctrine of the Prophets was so sensible that the kings understood their own
      abominations, and the people understood what they ought to have done in punishing and repressing them. But because
      the most part of the people were no less rebellious to God than were their princes, the one and the other convened
      against God and against His servants. And yet, my Lord, the acts of some Prophets are so evident, that we may collect
      from them what doctrine they taught; for it were no small absurdity to affirm that their acts should repugn to their
      doctrine.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p389" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> I think ye refer to the history of Jehu. What will ye prove thereby?
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p390" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> The chief head that ye deny and I affirm—that the Prophets never taught that it appertained to the people to
      punish the idolatry of their kings. For the probation, I am ready to produce the act of a Prophet. Ye know, my Lord,
      that Elisha sent one of the children of the Prophets to anoint Jehu, who gave him commandment to destroy the house
      of his master Ahab for the idolatry committed by him, and for the innocent blood that Jezebel his wicked wife had shed.
      He obeyed, and put this into full execution; and for this God promised him the stability of the kingdom, to the fourth
      generation. Here is the act of one Prophet that proves that<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_326">326</span> subjects
      were commanded to execute judgments upon their king and prince.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p391" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> There is enough to be answered thereto. Jehu was a king before he put anything in execution; and besides,
      the act is extraordinary, and not to be imitated.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p392" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> My Lord, he was a mere subject and no king, when the Prophet's servant came to him; yea, and albeit his fellow-captains,
      hearing of the message, blew the trumpet, and said, "Jehu is king;" I doubt not that Jezebel both thought and said
      he was a traitor. So did many others that were in Israel and in Samaria. And as touching what ye allege—that the act
      was extraordinary, and is not to be imitated—I say that it had ground upon God's ordinary judgment, which commands
      the idolater to die the death. Therefore, I yet again affirm that it is to be imitated by all those that prefer the
      true honour, the true worship, and the glory of God to the affections of flesh, and of wicked princes.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p393" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> We are not bound to imitate extraordinary examples, unless we have the like commandment and assurance.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p394" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I grant that, if the example repugn to the law, and if an avaricious and deceitful man desired to borrow gold,
      silver, raiment, or any other necessaries from his neighbour, and withhold the same, he might allege that he might
      do so and not offend God, because the Israelites did so to the Egyptians, at their departure from Egypt. The example
      would serve no purpose unless the like cause, and the like commandment to that which the Israelites had, could be produced;
      because, their act repugned to this commandment of God, "Thou shalt not steal." But where the example agrees with the
      law, and is, as it were, the execution of God's judgments expressed in it, I say that the example approved by God stands
      to us in place of a commandment. God of His nature is constant, and immutable; He cannot condemn in the subsequent
      ages that which He has approved in His servants before us. In His servants before us, by His own commandment, He has
      approved when subjects have not only destroyed their kings for idolatry, but also rooted<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_327">327</span>      out their whole posterity, so that none of that race were afterwards left to empire over the people of God.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p395" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Whatsoever they did was done at God's commandment.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p396" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> That fortifies my argument. You admit that subjects punish their princes by God's commandment for idolatry and
      wickedness committed by them.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p397" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> We have not the like commandment.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p398" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> That I deny. The commandment, "The idolater shall die the death," is perpetual, as ye yourself have granted.
      You doubted only who should be executors against the king; and I said the people of God. I have sufficiently proven,
      I think, that God has raised up the people, and by His Prophet has anointed a king to take vengeance upon the king
      and upon his posterity. Since that time, God has never retreated<sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p398.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p398.1">237</a></sup>
      <span class="mnote" id="mnf_iii.iv-p398.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.iv-p398.1">237</a></sup>Repudiated; withdrawn.</span>      that act; and, therefore, to me it remains for a constant and clean commandment to all people professing God, and having
      the power to punish vice, as to what they ought to do in the like case. If the people had enterprised anything without
      God's commandment, we might have doubted whether they had done well or evil. But, seeing that God did bring the execution
      of His law again into practice, after it had fallen into oblivion and contempt, what reasonable man can now doubt of
      God's will, unless we are to doubt of all things which God does not renew to us by miracles, as it were, from age to
      age. I am assured that the answer of Abraham to the rich man who, being in hell, desired that Lazarus or some of the
      dead should be sent to his brethren and friends, to inform them of his incredible pain and torments, and to warn them
      so to behave themselves that they should not come to that place of torment—that answer shall confound such as crave
      further approbation of God's will than is already expressed within His holy Scriptures. Abraham said, "They have Moses
      and the Prophets; if they will not believe them, neither will they believe albeit one of the dead should rise." Even
      so, my Lord, I say that such as will not be taught what they ought to do, by commandment of God once given and once
      put in practice,<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_328">328</span> will not believe or obey, albeit God should send angels
      from heaven to instruct that doctrine.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p399" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Ye have but produced one example.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p400" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> One sufficeth. But, God be praised, we do not lack others. The whole people conspired against Amaziah, king
      of Judah, after he had turned away from the Lord, followed him to Lachish and slew him, and took Uzziah and anointed
      him king instead of his father. The people had not altogether forgotten the league and covenant made betwixt their
      king and them, at the inauguration of Joash, his father, that the king and the people should be the people of the Lord,
      and then should they be his faithful subjects. When first the father, and afterwards the son, declined from that covenant,
      they were both punished to the death, Joash by his own servants, and Amaziah by the whole people.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p401" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> I doubt whether they did well or not.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p402" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> It shall be free for you to doubt as ye please; but where I find execution according to God's laws, and God
      Himself does not accuse the doers, I dare not doubt of the equity of the cause. Further, it appears to me that God
      gave sufficient approbation and allowance to their act; for He blessed them with victory, peace, and prosperity, for
      the space of fifty-two years thereafter.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p403" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> But prosperity does not always prove that God approves the acts of men.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p404" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Yes; when the acts of men agree with the law of God, and are rewarded according to God's own promise, expressed
      in His law, I say that the prosperity succeeding the act is most infallible assurance that God has approved that act.
      God has promised in His law that, when His people shall exterminate and destroy such as decline from Him, He will bless
      them, and multiply them, as He has promised to their fathers. Amaziah turned from God; for so the text doth witness;
      and it is plain that the people slew their king; and it is as plain that God blessed them. Therefore, yet again I conclude
      that God approved their act, and it, in so far as it was done according to His commandment, was blessed according to
      His promise.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p405" shownumber="no"><span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_329">329</span></p>
<p id="iii.iv-p406" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Well, I think the ground is not so sure that I durst build my conscience thereupon.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p407" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I pray God that your conscience have no worse ground than this, whenever ye shall begin work like that which
      God, before your own eyes, has already blessed. And now, my Lord, I have but one example to produce, and then I will
      put an end to my reasoning, because I weary of standing. (Commandment was given that he should sit down; but he refused
      it, and said, "Melancholious reasons would have some mirth intermixed.") My last example, my Lord, is this, Uzziah
      the king, not content of his royal estate, malapertly took upon him to enter within the temple of the Lord, to burn
      incense upon the altar of incense; and Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the
      Lord, valiant men. These withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, "It pertaineth thee not, Uzziah, to burn incense
      unto the Lord, but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to offer incense. Go forth of the sanctuary,
      for thou hast transgressed, and you shall have no honour of the Lord God." From this, my Lord, I conclude that subjects
      not only may, but ought to withstand and resist their princes, whenever they do anything that expressly repugns to
      God's law or holy ordinance.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p408" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> They that withstood the king were not simple subjects. They were the priests of the Lord, and figures
      of Christ. We have none such priests this day, to withstand kings if they do wrong.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p409" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> I grant that the High Priest was the figure of Christ, but I deny that he was not a subject. I am assured that
      he, in his priesthood, had no prerogative above those that had gone before him. Now, Aaron was subject unto Moses,
      and called him his lord. Samuel, being both prophet and priest, subjected himself to Saul, after he was inaugurated
      by the people. Zadok bowed before David; and Abiathar was deposed from the priesthood by Solomon. These all confessed
      themselves subjects to the kings, albeit therewith they ceased not to be figures of Christ. Ye say that we have no
      such priests this day, but I might answer that neither have we such kings this day as then were anointed at God's commandment,
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_330">330</span> and sat upon the seat of David, and were no less the figure of Christ
      Jesus in their just administration, than were the priests in their appointed office. Such kings, I am assured, we have
      not now, more than have we such priests. Christ Jesus, being anointed in our nature by God, His Father, as King, Priest,
      and Prophet, has put an end to all external unction. And yet, I think, ye will not say that God has now diminished
      His graces for those whom He appoints ambassadors betwixt Him and His people, more than He does from kings and princes.
      Therefore, I see not why the servants of Jesus Christ may not also justly withstand kings and princes that this day
      no less offend God's Majesty than Uzziah did, unless ye will say that we, in the brightness of the Evangel, are not
      straitly bound to regard God's glory or His commandments, as were the fathers that lived under the dark shadows of
      the law.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p410" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Well, I will dip no further into that head. But how resisted the priests the king? They only spake to
      him, without further violence intended.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p411" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> That they withstood him, the text assures me; but that they did nothing but speak, I cannot understand. The
      plain text affirms the contrary. They caused him hastily to depart from the sanctuary, yea, he was compelled to depart.
      This manner of speaking, I am assured, imports in the Hebrew tongue another thing than exhorting, or commanding by
      word.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p412" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> They did that after he was espied to be leprous.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p413" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> They withstood him before; but their last act confirms my proposition so evidently, that such as will oppose
      themselves to it must needs oppose themselves to God. My assertion is, that kings have no privilege to offend God's
      Majesty more than had the people; and that, if they do so, they are no more exempted from the punishment of the law
      than is any subject; yea, and that subjects may not only lawfully oppose themselves to their kings, whenever they do
      anything that expressly repugns to God's commandment, but also that they may execute judgment upon them according to
      God's law. If the king be a murderer, adulterer, or idolater, he should suffer<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_331">331</span>      according to God's law, not as a king, but as an offender, and this history clearly proves that the people may put
      God's laws into execution. As soon as the leprosy appeared in his forehead, he was not only compelled to depart out
      of the sanctuary, but he was also removed from all public society and administration of the kingdom, and was compelled
      to dwell in a house apart, even as the law commanded. He got no greater privilege in that case than any other of the
      people should have done; and this was executed by the people; for there is no doubt that more than the priests alone
      were witnesses of his leprosy. We do not find that any oppose themselves to the sentence of God pronounced in His law
      against the leprous; and therefore, yet again say I that the people ought to execute God's law even against their princes,
      when their open crimes deserve death by God's law, but especially when they are such as may infect the rest of the
      multitude. And now, my Lords, I will reason no longer, for I have spoken more than I intended.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p414" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> And yet I cannot tell what can be concluded.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p415" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> Albeit ye cannot, I am assured of what I have proven, to wit:—1. That subjects have delivered an innocent from
      the hands of their king, and therein offended not God. 2. That subjects have refused to strike innocents when a king
      commanded, and in doing so denied no just obedience. 3. That such as struck at the commandment of the king before God
      were reputed murderers. 4. That God has not only of one subject made a king, but also has armed subjects against their
      natural kings, and commanded them to take vengeance upon them according to His law. 5. That God's people have executed
      God's law against their king, having no further regard to him in that behalf, than if he had been the most simple subject
      within this realm. Therefore, albeit ye will not understand what should be concluded, I am assured not only that God's
      people may, but also that they are bound to do the same where the like crimes are committed, and when He gives unto
      them the like power.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p416" shownumber="no"><i>Lethington.</i> Well, I think ye shall not have many learned men of your opinion.

<p id="iii.iv-p418" shownumber="no"><i>Knox.</i> My Lord, the truth ceases not to be the truth, howsoever men either misknow it, or yet gainstand it. And yet,
      I praise my God that I lack not the consent of God's servants in that head.

<p id="iii.iv-p419" shownumber="no">With that, John Knox presented to the Secretary the Apology of Magdeburg; and willed him to read the names of the ministers
      who had subscribed the defence of the town to be a most just one; adding, that to resist a tyrant is not to resist
      God, or yet His ordinance.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p420" shownumber="no">When the Secretary had read this, he scripped and said, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homines obscuri</i>."<sup class="Note"

<p id="iii.iv-p421" shownumber="no">So Lethington arose and said, "My Lords, ye have heard the reasons upon both sides: it becomes you now to decide, and to
      give an order unto preachers, that they may be uniform in doctrine. May we, think ye, take the Queen's Mass from her?"
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p422" shownumber="no">While some began to give their votes, for some were appointed, as it were, leaders to the rest, John Knox said, "My Lords,
      I suppose that ye will not do contrary to your Lordships' promise, made to the whole Assembly. This was that nothing
      should be voted in secret, until all matters should first be debated in public, and that then the votes of the whole
      Assembly should put an end to the controversy. Now have I only sustained the argument, and shown my conscience in most
      simple manner, rather than insisted upon the force and vehemence of any one argument. Therefore I, for my part, utterly
      dissent from all voting, until the whole Assembly have heard the propositions and the reasons of both parties. For
      I unfeignedly acknowledge that many in this company are more able to sustain the argument than I am.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p423" shownumber="no">"Think ye it reasonable," said Lethington, "that such a multitude as are now convened should reason and vote in these heads
      and matters that concern the Queen's Majesty's own person and affairs."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p424" shownumber="no">"I think," said the other, "that, whosoever should bind,<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_333">333</span> the multitude should
      hear, unless they have resigned their power to their commissioners. This they have not done, so far as I understand;
      for my Lord Justice Clerk heard them say, with one voice, that in nowise would they consent that anything should either
      be voted or concluded here."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p425" shownumber="no">"I cannot tell," said Lethington, "if my Lords that be here present, and that bear the burden of such matters, should be
      bound to their will. What say ye, my Lords? Will ye vote in this matter, or will ye not vote?"
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p426" shownumber="no">After long reasoning, some that were made for the purpose said, "Why may not the Lords vote, and then show unto the Kirk
      whatsoever is done?"
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p427" shownumber="no">"That appears to me," said John Knox, "not only a backward order, but also a tyranny usurped upon the Kirk. For me, do as
      ye list, as I reason, so I vote; yet I protest, as before, that I dissent from all voting, until the whole Assembly
      understand the questions as well as the reasonings."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p428" shownumber="no">"Well," said Lethington, "that cannot be done now, for the time is spent; and therefore, my Lord Chancellor, said he, ask
      ye the votes, and take by course every one of the ministers, and one of us."

<p id="iii.iv-p429" shownumber="no">The Rector of St. Andrews, first commanded to speak his conscience, said, "I refer to the Superintendent of Fife, for I think
      we are both of one judgment; and yet, if ye will that I speak first, my conscience is this. If the Queen oppose herself
      to our religion, which is the only true religion, the Nobility and Estates of this realm, professors of the true doctrine,
      may justly oppose themselves to her. But, as concerning her own Mass, albeit I know it is idolatry, I am not yet resolved,
      whether or not we may take it from her by violence." The Superintendent of Fife said, "That is my conscience." So also
      affirmed some of the Nobility. But others voted frankly, and said that, as the Mass was an abomination, it was just
      and right that it should be suppressed; and that, in so doing, men did no more wrong to the Queen's Majesty than would
      they that should, by force, take from her a poisoned cup when she was going to drink it.

<div class="sidenote" id="iii.iv-p430.1">Mr John Craig's Judgment.
</div>
<p id="iii.iv-p431" shownumber="no">At last, Mr. John Craig, fellow-minister with John Knox in the Kirk of Edinburgh, was required to give his judgment and vote.
      "I will gladly show to your Honours what I understand," he said; "but I greatly doubt whether my knowledge and conscience
      shall satisfy you, seeing that ye have heard so many reasons, and are so little moved by them. But yet I shall not
      conceal from you my judgment, adhering first to the protestation of my brother that our voting prejudge not the liberty
      of the General Assembly. I was in the University of Bologna in the year of God 1554, and there, in the place of the
      Black Friars of the same town, I saw in the time of their General Assembly this conclusion set forth. This I heard
      reasoned, determined, and concluded:—'All rulers, be they supreme or be they inferior, may be and ought to be reformed
      or deposed by them by whom they are chosen, confirmed, or admitted to their office, as oft as they break that promise
      made by the oath to their subjects. Princes are no less bound by oath to the subjects, than are the subjects to their
      princes, and therefore ought to be kept and reformed equally, according to the law and condition of the oath that is
      made by either party.'
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p432" shownumber="no">"This conclusion, my Lords, I heard sustained and concluded, as I have said, in a most notable auditory. The sustainer was
      a learned man, Monsieur Thomas de Finola, the Rector of the University, a man famous in that country. Magister Vincentius
      de Placentia affirmed the conclusion to be most true and certain, agreeable both with the law of God and man. The occasion
      of this disputation and conclusion was a certain disorder and tyranny attempted by the Pope's governors. These began
      to make innovations in the country against the laws formerly established, alleging themselves not to be subject to
      such laws, by reason that they were not institute
      <sup class="Note" id="fna_iii.iv-p432.1"><a class="Note" href="#fnf_iii.iv-p432.1">240</a></sup><span class="mnote"
            id="mnf_iii.iv-p432.1"><sup><a class="NoteRef" href="#fna_iii.iv-p432.1">240</a></sup>Placed in authority.</span> by
      the people, but by the Pope, who was king of that country. They claimed that they, having full commission and authority
      from the Pope, might alter and change statutes and ordinances of the country, without any consent of the people. Against
      this usurped tyranny, the learned and the<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_335">335</span> people opposed themselves
      openly. When all reasons which the Pope's governors could allege were heard and confuted, the Pope himself was fain
      to take up the matter, and to promise, not only to keep the liberty of the people, but also that he should neither
      abrogate any law or statute, nor make any new law without their own consent. Therefore, my Lord, my vote and conscience
      is, that the princes are not only bound to keep laws and promises to their subjects, but also that, in case they fail,
      they may be justly deposed; for the bond betwixt the prince and the people is reciprocal."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p433" shownumber="no">Then started up a clawback of that corrupt Court, and said, "Ye wot not what ye say; for ye tell us what was done in Bologna;
      we are a kingdom, and they are but a commonwealth."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p434" shownumber="no">"My Lord," said he, "my judgment is, that every kingdom is or, at least, should be a commonwealth, albeit every commonwealth
      be not a kingdom; and, therefore, I think that, in a kingdom no less than in a commonwealth, diligence ought to be
      taken that laws be not violated. The tyranny of princes who continually reign in a kingdom is more hurtful to the subjects,
      than is the misgovernment of those that from year to year are changed in free commonwealths. But yet, my Lords, to
      assure you and all others further, that head was disputed to the uttermost; and then, in the end, it was concluded,
      that they spoke not of such things as were done in divers kingdoms and nations by tyranny and negligence of people.
      'But we conclude,' said they, 'what ought to be done in all kingdoms and commonwealths, according to the law of God,
      and the just laws of man. And if, by the negligence of the people, or by the tyranny of princes, contrary laws have
      been made, yet may that same people, or their posterity, justly crave all things to be reformed, according to the original
      institution of kings and commonwealths; and such as will not do so, deserve to eat the fruit of their own foolishness.'"
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p435" shownumber="no">Master James Macgill, then Clerk of Register, perceiving the votes to be different, and hearing the bold plainness of the
      foresaid servant of God, said, "I remember that this same question was long debated once before this in my house, and
      <span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_336">336</span> there, by reason that we were not all of one mind, it was concluded
      that Mr. Knox should, in all our names, write to Mr. Calvin for his judgment in the controversy."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p436" shownumber="no">"Nay," said Mr. Knox, "my Lord Secretary would not consent that I should write, alleging that the greatest weight of the
      answer stood in the narrative, and therefore promised that he would write, and I should see it. But when, at divers
      times, I required him to remember his promise, I found nothing but delay."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p437" shownumber="no">Thereto the Secretary did answer, "True it is, I promised to write, and true it is, that divers times Mr. Knox required me
      so to do. But, when I had more deeply considered the weight of the matter, I began to find more doubts than I did before,
      and this one amongst others, how durst I, being a subject, and the Queen's Majesty's Secretary, take upon me, without
      her own knowledge and consent, to seek resolution of controversies depending betwixt her Highness and her subjects."
      Then was there an acclamation of the clawbacks of the Court, as if Apollo had given his response. It was wisely and
      faithfully done.
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p438" shownumber="no">"Well," said John Knox, "let worldly men praise worldly wisdom as highly as they please, I am assured that by such shifts
      idolatry is maintained, and the truth of Jesus Christ is betrayed. God one day will be revenged." At this and the like
      sharpness many were offended, the voting ceased, and every faction began plainly to speak as affection moved them.
      In the end John Knox was commanded yet to write to Mr. Calvin, and to the learned in other Kirks, to ascertain their
      judgments on that question. This he refused, stating his reason. "I myself am not only fully resolved in conscience,
      but also I have heard the judgments of the most godly and most learned that be known in Europe, in this and all other
      things that I have affirmed within this realm. I came not to this realm without their resolution; and for my assurance
      I have the handwritings of many. Therefore, if I should now move the same question again, what should I do but either
      show my own ignorance and forgetfulness, or else inconstancy? So may it please you to pardon me, albeit I write not.
      But I<span class="pb" id="iii.iv-Page_337">337</span> will teach you the surer way, which is this, write ye and complain
      upon me, that I teach publicly and affirm constantly such doctrine as offends you, and so shall ye know their plain
      minds, and whether I and they agree in judgment or not."
</p>
<p id="iii.iv-p439" shownumber="no">Divers said the offer was good; but no man was found that would be the secretary. And so did the Assembly break up after
      long reasoning. After that time, the ministers were holden of all the courtiers as monsters.
